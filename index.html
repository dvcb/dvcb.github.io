<div id="taoContent">
<p id="t1d01">The tao that can be told
is not the eternal Tao
The name that can be named
is not the eternal Name.

The unnameable is the eternally real.
Naming is the origin
of all particular things.

Free from desire, you realize the mystery.
Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.

Yet mystery and manifestations
arise from the same source.
This source is called darkness.

Darkness within darkness.
The gateway to all understanding. </p>
<p id="t1d02">When people see some things as beautiful,
other things become ugly.
When people see some things as good,
other things become bad.

Being and non-being create each other.
Difficult and easy support each other.
Long and short define each other.
High and low depend on each other.
Before and after follow each other.

Therefore the Master
acts without doing anything
and teaches without saying anything.
Things arise and she lets them come;
things disappear and she lets them go.
She has but doesn't possess,
acts but doesn't expect.
When her work is done, she forgets it.
That is why it lasts forever. </p>
<p id="t1d03">If you over-esteem great men,
people become powerless.
If you overvalue possessions,
people begin to steal.

The Master leads
by emptying people's minds
and filling their cores,
by weakening their ambition
and toughening their resolve.
He helps people lose everything
they know, everything they desire,
and creates confusion
in those who think that they know.

Practice not-doing,
and everything will fall into place. </p>
<p id="t1d04">The Tao is like a well:
used but never used up.
It is like the eternal void:
filled with infinite possibilities.

It is hidden but always present.
I don't know who gave birth to it.
It is older than God. </p>
<p id="t1d05">The Tao doesn't take sides;
it gives birth to both good and evil.
The Master doesn't take sides;
she welcomes both saints and sinners.

The Tao is like a bellows:
it is empty yet infinitely capable.
The more you use it, the more it produces;
the more you talk of it, the less you understand.

Hold on to the center. </p>
<p id="t1d06">The Tao is called the Great Mother:
empty yet inexhaustible,
it gives birth to infinite worlds.

It is always present within you.
You can use it any way you want. </p>
<p id="t1d07">The Tao is infinite, eternal.
Why is it eternal?
It was never born;
thus it can never die.
Why is it infinite?
It has no desires for itself;
thus it is present for all beings.

The Master stays behind;
that is why she is ahead.
She is detached from all things;
that is why she is one with them.
Because she has let go of herself,
she is perfectly fulfilled. </p>
<p id="t1d08">The supreme good is like water,
which nourishes all things without trying to.
It is content with the low places that people disdain.
Thus it is like the Tao.

In dwelling, live close to the ground.
In thinking, keep to the simple.
In conflict, be fair and generous.
In governing, don't try to control.
In work, do what you enjoy.
In family life, be completely present.

When you are content to be simply yourself
and don't compare or compete,
everybody will respect you. </p>
<p id="t1d09">Fill your bowl to the brim
and it will spill.
Keep sharpening your knife
and it will blunt.
Chase after money and security
and your heart will never unclench.
Care about people's approval
and you will be their prisoner.

Do your work, then step back.
The only path to serenity. </p>
<p id="t1d10">Can you coax your mind from its wandering
and keep to the original oneness?
Can you let your body become
supple as a newborn child's?
Can you cleanse your inner vision
until you see nothing but the light?
Can you love people and lead them
without imposing your will?
Can you deal with the most vital matters
by letting events take their course?
Can you step back from your own mind
and thus understand all things?

Giving birth and nourishing,
having without possessing,
acting with no expectations,
leading and not trying to control:
this is the supreme virtue. </p>
<p id="t1d11">We join spokes together in a wheel,
but it is the center hole
that makes the wagon move.

We shape clay into a pot,
but it is the emptiness inside
that holds whatever we want.

We hammer wood for a house,
but it is the inner space
that makes it livable.

We work with being,
but non-being is what we use. </p>
<p id="t1d12">Colors blind the eye.
Sounds deafen the ear.
Flavors numb the taste.
Thoughts weaken the mind.
Desires wither the heart.

The Master observes the world
but trusts his inner vision.
He allows things to come and go.
His heart is open as the sky. </p>
<p id="t1d13">Success is as dangerous as failure.
Hope is as hollow as fear.

What does it mean that success is a dangerous as failure?
Whether you go up the ladder or down it,
your position is shaky.
When you stand with your two feet on the ground,
you will always keep your balance.

What does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear?
Hope and fear are both phantoms
that arise from thinking of the self.
When we don't see the self as self,
what do we have to fear?

See the world as your self.
Have faith in the way things are.
Love the world as your self;
then you can care for all things. </p>
<p id="t1d14">Look, and it can't be seen.
Listen, and it can't be heard.
Reach, and it can't be grasped.

Above, it isn't bright.
Below, it isn't dark.
Seamless, unnameable,
it returns to the realm of nothing.
Form that includes all forms,
image without an image,
subtle, beyond all conception.

Approach it and there is no beginning;
follow it and there is no end.
You can't know it, but you can be it,
at ease in your own life.
Just realize where you come from:
this is the essence of wisdom. </p>
<p id="t1d15">The ancient Masters were profound and subtle.
Their wisdom was unfathomable.
There is no way to describe it;
all we can describe is their appearance.

They were careful
as someone crossing an iced-over stream.
Alert as a warrior in enemy territory.
Courteous as a guest.
Fluid as melting ice.
Shapable as a block of wood.
Receptive as a valley.
Clear as a glass of water.

Do you have the patience to wait
till your mud settles and the water is clear?
Can you remain unmoving
till the right action arises by itself?

The Master doesn't seek fulfillment.
Not seeking, not expecting,
she is present, and can welcome all things. </p>
<p id="t1d16">Empty your mind of all thoughts.
Let your heart be at peace.
Watch the turmoil of beings,
but contemplate their return.

Each separate being in the universe
returns to the common source.
Returning to the source is serenity.

If you don't realize the source,
you stumble in confusion and sorrow.
When you realize where you come from,
you naturally become tolerant,
disinterested, amused,
kindhearted as a grandmother,
dignified as a king.
Immersed in the wonder of the Tao,
you can deal with whatever life brings you,
and when death comes, you are ready. </p>
<p id="t1d17">When the Master governs, the people
are hardly aware that he exists.
Next best is a leader who is loved.
Next, one who is feared.
The worst is one who is despised.

If you don't trust the people,
you make them untrustworthy.

The Master doesn't talk, he acts.
When his work is done,
the people say, "Amazing: we did it, all by ourselves!" </p>
<p id="t1d18">When the great Tao is forgotten,
goodness and piety appear.
When the body's intelligence declines,
cleverness and knowledge step forth.
When there is no peace in the family,
filial piety begins.
When the country falls into chaos,
patriotism is born. </p>
<p id="t1d19">Throw away holiness and wisdom,
and people will be a hundred times happier.
Throw away morality and justice,
and people will do the right thing.
Throw away industry and profit,
and there won't be any thieves.

If these three aren't enough,
just stay at the center of the circle
and let all things take their course. </p>
<p id="t1d20">Stop thinking, and end your problems.
What difference between yes and no?
What difference between success and failure?
Must you value what others value,
avoid what others avoid?
How ridiculous!

Other people are excited,
as though they were at a parade.
I alone don't care,
I alone am expressionless,
like an infant before it can smile.

Other people have what they need;
I alone possess nothing.
I alone drift about,
like someone without a home.
I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty.

Other people are bright;
I alone am dark.
Other people are sharper;
I alone am dull.
Other people have a purpose;
I alone don't know.
I drift like a wave on the ocean,
I blow as aimless as the wind.

I am different from ordinary people.
I drink from the Great Mother's breasts. </p>
<p id="t1d21">The Master keeps her mind
always at one with the Tao;
that is what gives her radiance.

The Tao is ungraspable.
How can her mind be at one with it?
Because she doesn't cling to ideas.

The Tao is dark and unfathomable.
How can it make her radiant?
Because she lets it.

Since before time and space were,
the Tao is.
It is beyond is and is not .
How do I know this is true?
I look inside myself and see. </p>
<p id="t1d22">If you want to become whole,
let yourself be partial.
If you want to become straight,
let yourself be crooked.
If you want to become full,
let yourself be empty.
If you want to be reborn,
let yourself die.
If you want to be given everything,
give everything up.

The Master, by residing in the Tao,
sets an example for all beings.
Because he doesn't display himself,
people can see his light.
Because he has nothing to prove,
people can trust his words.
Because he doesn't know who he is,
people recognize themselves in him.
Because he has no goal in mind,
everything he does succeeds.

When the ancient Masters said,
"If you want to be given everything, give everything up,"
they weren't using empty phrases.
Only in being lived by the Tao can you be truly yourself. </p>
<p id="t1d23">Express yourself completely,
then keep quiet.
Be like the forces of nature:
when it blows, there is only wind;
when it rains, there is only rain;
when the clouds pass, the sun shines through.

If you open yourself to the Tao,
you are at one with the Tao
and you can embody it completely.
If you open yourself to insight,
you are at one with insight
and you can use it completely.
If you open yourself to loss,
you are at one with loss
and you can accept it completely.

Open yourself to the Tao,
then trust your natural responses;
and everything will fall into place. </p>
<p id="t1d24">He who stands on tiptoe
doesn't stand firm.
He who rushes ahead
doesn't go far.
He who tries to shine
dims his own light.
He who defines himself
can't know who he really is.
He who has power over others
can't empower himself.
He who clings to his work
will create nothing that endures.

If you want to accord with the Tao,
just do your job, then let go. </p>
<p id="t1d25">There was something formless and perfect
before the universe was born.
It is serene. Empty.
Solitary. Unchanging.
Infinite. Eternally present.
It is the mother of the universe.
For lack of a better name,
I call it the Tao.

It flows through all things,
inside and outside, and returns
to the origin of all things.

The Tao is great.
The universe is great.
Earth is great.
Man is great.
These are the four great powers.

Man follows the earth.
Earth follows the universe.
The universe follows the Tao.
The Tao follows only itself. </p>
<p id="t1d26">The heavy is the root of the light.
The unmoved is the source of all movement.

Thus the Master travels all day
without leaving home.
However splendid the views,
she stays serenely in herself.

Why should the lord of the country
flit about like a fool?
If you let yourself be blown to and fro,
you lose touch with your root.
If you let restlessness move you,
you lose touch with who you are. </p>
<p id="t1d27">A good traveler has no fixed plans
and is not intent upon arriving.
A good artist lets his intuition
lead him wherever it wants.
A good scientist has freed himself of concepts
and keeps his mind open to what is.

Thus the Master is available to all people
and doesn't reject anyone.
He is ready to use all situations
and doesn't waste anything.
This is called embodying the light.

What is a good man but a bad man's teacher?
What is a bad man but a good man's job?
If you don't understand this, you will get lost,
however intelligent you are.
It is the great secret. </p>
<p id="t1d28">Know the male,
yet keep to the female:
receive the world in your arms.
If you receive the world,
the Tao will never leave you
and you will be like a little child.

Know the white,
yet keep to the black:
be a pattern for the world.
If you are a pattern for the world,
the Tao will be strong inside you
and there will be nothing you can't do.

Know the personal,
yet keep to the impersonal:
accept the world as it is.
If you accept the world,
the Tao will be luminous inside you
and you will return to your primal self.

The world is formed from the void,
like utensils from a block of wood.
The Master knows the utensils,
yet keeps to the block:
thus she can use all things. </p>
<p id="t1d29">Do you want to improve the world?
I don't think it can be done.

The world is sacred.
It can't be improved.
If you tamper with it, you'll ruin it.
If you treat it like an object, you'll lose it.

There is a time for being ahead,
a time for being behind;
a time for being in motion,
a time for being at rest;
a time for being vigorous,
a time for being exhausted;
a time for being safe,
a time for being in danger.

The Master sees things as they are,
without trying to control them.
She lets them go their own way,
and resides at the center of the circle. </p>
<p id="t1d30">Whoever relies on the Tao in governing men
doesn't try to force issues
or defeat enemies by force of arms.
For every force there is a counterforce.
Violence, even well intentioned,
always rebounds upon oneself.

The Master does his job
and then stops.
He understands that the universe
is forever out of control,
and that trying to dominate events
goes against the current of the Tao.
Because he believes in himself,
he doesn't try to convince others.
Because he is content with himself,
he doesn't need others' approval.
Because he accepts himself,
the whole world accepts him. </p>
<p id="t1d31">Weapons are the tools of violence;
all decent men detest them.

Weapons are the tools of fear;
a decent man will avoid them
except in the direst necessity
and, if compelled, will use them
only with the utmost restraint.
Peace is his highest value.
If the peace has been shattered,
how can he be content?
His enemies are not demons,
but human beings like himself.
He doesn't wish them personal harm.
Nor does he rejoice in victory.
How could he rejoice in victory
and delight in the slaughter of men?

He enters a battle gravely,
with sorrow and with great compassion,
as if he were attending a funeral. </p>
<p id="t1d32">The Tao can't be perceived.
Smaller than an electron,
it contains uncountable galaxies.

If powerful men and women
could remain centered in the Tao,
all things would be in harmony.
The world would become a paradise.
All people would be at peace,
and the law would be written in their hearts.

When you have names and forms,
know that they are provisional.
When you have institutions,
know where their functions should end.
Knowing when to stop,
you can avoid any danger.

All things end in the Tao
as rivers flow into the sea. </p>
<p id="t1d33">Knowing others is intelligence;
knowing yourself is true wisdom.
Mastering others is strength;
mastering yourself is true power.

If you realize that you have enough,
you are truly rich.
If you stay in the center
and embrace death with your whole heart,
you will endure forever. </p>
<p id="t1d34">The great Tao flows everywhere.
All things are born from it,
yet it doesn't create them.
It pours itself into its work,
yet it makes no claim.
It nourishes infinite worlds,
yet it doesn't hold on to them.
Since it is merged with all things
and hidden in their hearts,
it can be called humble.
Since all things vanish into it
and it alone endures,
it can be called great.
It isn't aware of its greatness;
thus it is truly great.
</p>
<p id="t1d35">She who is centered in the Tao
can go where she wishes, without danger.
She perceives the universal harmony,
even amid great pain,
because she has found peace in her heart.

Music or the smell of good cooking
may make people stop and enjoy.
But words that point to the Tao
seem monotonous and without flavor.
When you look for it, there is nothing to see.
When you listen for it, there is nothing to hear.
When you use it, it is inexhaustible. </p>
<p id="t1d36">If you want to shrink something,
you must first allow it to expand.
If you want to get rid of something,
you must first allow it to flourish.
If you want to take something,
you must first allow it to be given.
This is called the subtle perception
of the way things are.

The soft overcomes the hard.
The slow overcomes the fast.
Let your workings remain a mystery.
Just show people the results. </p>
<p id="t1d37">The Tao never does anything,
yet through it all things are done.

If powerful men and women
could center themselves in it,
the whole world would be transformed
by itself, in its natural rhythms.
People would be content
with their simple, everyday lives,
in harmony, and free of desire.

When there is no desire,
all things are at peace. </p>
<p id="t1d38">The Master doesn't try to be powerful;
thus he is truly powerful.
The ordinary man keeps reaching for power;
thus he never has enough.

The Master does nothing,
yet he leaves nothing undone.
The ordinary man is always doing things,
yet many more are left to be done.

The kind man does something,
yet something remains undone.
The just man does something,
and leaves many things to be done.
The moral man does something,
and when no one responds
he rolls up his sleeves and uses force.

When the Tao is lost, there is goodness.
When goodness is lost, there is morality.
When morality is lost, there is ritual.
Ritual is the husk of true faith,
the beginning of chaos.

Therefore the Master concerns himself
with the depths and not the surface,
with the fruit and not the flower.
He has no will of his own.
He dwells in reality,
and lets all illusions go. </p>
<p id="t1d39">In harmony with the Tao,
the sky is clear and spacious,
the earth is solid and full,
all creature flourish together,
content with the way they are,
endlessly repeating themselves,
endlessly renewed.

When man interferes with the Tao,
the sky becomes filthy,
the earth becomes depleted,
the equilibrium crumbles,
creatures become extinct.

The Master views the parts with compassion,
because he understands the whole.
His constant practice is humility.
He doesn't glitter like a jewel
but lets himself be shaped by the Tao,
as rugged and common as stone. </p>
<p id="t1d40">Return is the movement of the Tao.
Yielding is the way of the Tao.

All things are born of being.
Being is born of non-being. </p>
<p id="t1d41">When a superior man hears of the Tao,
he immediately begins to embody it.
When an average man hears of the Tao,
he half believes it, half doubts it.
When a foolish man hears of the Tao,
he laughs out loud.
If he didn't laugh,
it wouldn't be the Tao.

Thus it is said:
The path into the light seems dark,
the path forward seems to go back,
the direct path seems long,
true power seems weak,
true purity seems tarnished,
true steadfastness seems changeable,
true clarity seems obscure,
the greatest art seems unsophisticated,
the greatest love seems indifferent,
the greatest wisdom seems childish.

The Tao is nowhere to be found.
Yet it nourishes and completes all things. </p>
<p id="t1d42">The Tao gives birth to One.
One gives birth to Two.
Two gives birth to Three.
Three gives birth to all things.

All things have their backs to the female
and stand facing the male.
When male and female combine,
all things achieve harmony.

Ordinary men hate solitude.
But the Master makes use of it,
embracing his aloneness, realizing
he is one with the whole universe. </p>
<p id="t1d43">The gentlest thing in the world
overcomes the hardest thing in the world.
That which has no substance
enters where there is no space.
This shows the value of non-action.

Teaching without words,
performing without actions:
that is the Master's way. </p>
<p id="t1d44">Fame or integrity: which is more important?
Money or happiness: which is more valuable?
Success or failure: which is more destructive?

If you look to others for fulfillment,
you will never truly be fulfilled.
If your happiness depends on money,
you will never be happy with yourself.

Be content with what you have;
rejoice in the way things are.
When you realize there is nothing lacking,
the whole world belongs to you. </p>
<p id="t1d45">True perfection seems imperfect,
yet it is perfectly itself.
True fullness seems empty,
yet it is fully present.

True straightness seems crooked.
True wisdom seems foolish.
True art seems artless.

The Master allows things to happen.
She shapes events as they come.
She steps out of the way
and lets the Tao speak for itself. </p>
<p id="t1d46">When a country is in harmony with the Tao,
the factories make trucks and tractors.
When a country goes counter to the Tao,
warheads are stockpiled outside the cities.

There is no greater illusion than fear,
no greater wrong than preparing to defend yourself,
no greater misfortune than having an enemy.

Whoever can see through all fear
will always be safe. </p>
<p id="t1d47">Without opening your door,
you can open your heart to the world.
Without looking out your window,
you can see the essence of the Tao.

The more you know,
the less you understand.

The Master arrives without leaving,
sees the light without looking,
achieves without doing a thing. </p>
<p id="t1d48">In pursuit of knowledge,
every day something is added.
In the practice of the Tao,
every day something is dropped.
Less and less do you need to force things,
until finally you arrive at non-action.
When nothing is done,
nothing is left undone.

True mastery can be gained
by letting things go their own way.
It can't be gained by interfering. </p>
<p id="t1d49">The Master has no mind of her own.
She works with the mind of the people.

She is good to people who are good.
She is also good to people who aren't good.
This is true goodness.

She trusts people who are trustworthy.
She also trusts people who aren't trustworthy.
This is true trust.

The Master's mind is like space.
People don't understand her.
They look to her and wait.
She treats them like her own children. </p>
<p id="t1d50">The Master gives himself up
to whatever the moment brings.
He knows that he is going to die,
and he has nothing left to hold on to:
no illusions in his mind,
no resistances in his body.
He doesn't think about his actions;
they flow from the core of his being.
He holds nothing back from life;
therefore he is ready for death,
as a man is ready for sleep
after a good day's work. </p>
<p id="t1d51">Every being in the universe
is an expression of the Tao.
It springs into existence,
unconscious, perfect, free,
takes on a physical body,
lets circumstances complete it.
That is why every being
spontaneously honors the Tao.

The Tao gives birth to all beings,
nourishes them, maintains them,
cares for them, comforts them, protects them,
takes them back to itself,
creating without possessing,
acting without expecting,
guiding without interfering.
That is why love of the Tao
is in the very nature of things. </p>
<p id="t1d52">In the beginning was the Tao.
All things issue from it;
all things return to it.

To find the origin,
trace back the manifestations.
When you recognize the children
and find the mother,
you will be free of sorrow.

If you close your mind in judgments
and traffic with desires,
your heart will be troubled.
If you keep your mind from judging
and aren't led by the senses,
your heart will find peace.

Seeing into darkness is clarity.
Knowing how to yield is strength.
Use your own light
and return to the source of light.
This is called practicing eternity. </p>
<p id="t1d53">The great Way is easy,
yet people prefer the side paths.
Be aware when things are out of balance.
Stay centered within the Tao.

When rich speculators prosper
While farmers lose their land;
when government officials spend money
on weapons instead of cures;
when the upper class is extravagant and irresponsible
while the poor have nowhere to turn-
all this is robbery and chaos.
It is not in keeping with the Tao. </p>
<p id="t1d54">Whoever is planted in the Tao
will not be rooted up.
Whoever embraces the Tao
will not slip away.
Her name will be held in honor
from generation to generation.

Let the Tao be present in your life
and you will become genuine.
Let it be present in your family
and your family will flourish.
Let it be present in your country
and your country will be an example
to all countries in the world.
Let it be present in the universe
and the universe will sing.

How do I know this is true?
By looking inside myself. </p>
<p id="t1d55">He who is in harmony with the Tao
is like a newborn child.
Its bones are soft, its muscles are weak,
but its grip is powerful.
It doesn't know about the union
of male and female,
yet its penis can stand erect,
so intense is its vital power.
It can scream its head off all day,
yet it never becomes hoarse,
so complete is its harmony.

The Master's power is like this.
He lets all things come and go
effortlessly, without desire.
He never expects results;
thus he is never disappointed.
He is never disappointed;
thus his spirit never grows old. </p>
<p id="t1d56">Those who know don't talk.
Those who talk don't know.

Close your mouth,
block off your senses,
blunt your sharpness,
untie your knots,
soften your glare,
settle your dust.
This is the primal identity.

Be like the Tao.
It can't be approached or withdrawn from,
benefited or harmed,
honored or brought into disgrace.
It gives itself up continually.
That is why it endures. </p>
<p id="t1d57">If you want to be a great leader,
you must learn to follow the Tao.
Stop trying to control.
Let go of fixed plans and concepts,
and the world will govern itself.

The more prohibitions you have,
the less virtuous people will be.
The more weapons you have,
the less secure people will be.
The more subsidies you have,
the less self-reliant people will be.

Therefore the Master says:
I let go of the law,
and people become honest.
I let go of economics,
and people become prosperous.
I let go of religion,
and people become serene.
I let go of all desire for the common good,
and the good becomes common as grass. </p>
<p id="t1d58">If a country is governed with tolerance,
the people are comfortable and honest.
If a country is governed with repression,
the people are depressed and crafty.

When the will to power is in charge,
the higher the ideals, the lower the results.
Try to make people happy,
and you lay the groundwork for misery.
Try to make people moral,
and you lay the groundwork for vice.

Thus the Master is content
to serve as an example
and not to impose her will.
She is pointed, but doesn't pierce.
Straightforward, but supple.
Radiant, but easy on the eyes. </p>
<p id="t1d59">For governing a country well
there is nothing better than moderation.

The mark of a moderate man
is freedom from his own ideas.
Tolerant like the sky,

all-pervading like sunlight,
firm like a mountain,
supple like a tree in the wind,
he has no destination in view
and makes use of anything
life happens to bring his way.

Nothing is impossible for him.
Because he has let go,
he can care for the people's welfare
as a mother cares for her child. </p>
<p id="t1d60">Governing a large country
is like frying a small fish.
You spoil it with too much poking.

Center your country in the Tao
and evil will have no power.
Not that it isn't there,
but you'll be able to step out of its way.

Give evil nothing to oppose
and it will disappear by itself. </p>
<p id="t1d61">When a country obtains great power,
it becomes like the sea:
all streams run downward into it.
The more powerful it grows,
the greater the need for humility.
Humility means trusting the Tao,
thus never needing to be defensive.

A great nation is like a great man:
When he makes a mistake, he realizes it.
Having realized it, he admits it.
Having admitted it, he corrects it.
He considers those who point out his faults
as his most benevolent teachers.
He thinks of his enemy
as the shadow that he himself casts.

If a nation is centered in the Tao,
if it nourishes its own people
and doesn't meddle in the affairs of others,
it will be a light to all nations in the world. </p>
<p id="t1d62">The Tao is the center of the universe,
the good man's treasure,
the bad man's refuge.

Honors can be bought with fine words,
respect can be won with good deeds;
but the Tao is beyond all value,
and no one can achieve it.

Thus, when a new leader is chosen,
don't offer to help him
with your wealth or your expertise.
Offer instead
to teach him about the Tao.

Why did the ancient Masters esteem the Tao?
Because, being one with the Tao,
when you seek, you find;
and when you make a mistake, you are forgiven.
That is why everybody loves it. </p>
<p id="t1d63">Act without doing;
work without effort.
Think of the small as large
and the few as many.
Confront the difficult
while it is still easy;
accomplish the great task
by a series of small acts.

The Master never reaches for the great;
thus she achieves greatness.
When she runs into a difficulty,
she stops and gives herself to it.
She doesn't cling to her own comfort;
thus problems are no problem for her. </p>
<p id="t1d64">What is rooted is easy to nourish.
What is recent is easy to correct.
What is brittle is easy to break.
What is small is easy to scatter.

Prevent trouble before it arises.
Put things in order before they exist.
The giant pine tree
grows from a tiny sprout.
The journey of a thousand miles
starts from beneath your feet.

Rushing into action, you fail.
Trying to grasp things, you lose them.
Forcing a project to completion,
you ruin what was almost ripe.

Therefore the Master takes action
by letting things take their course.
He remains as calm
at the end as at the beginning.
He has nothing,
thus has nothing to lose.
What he desires is non-desire;
what he learns is to unlearn.
He simply reminds people
of who they have always been.
He cares about nothing but the Tao.
Thus he can care for all things. </p>
<p id="t1d65">The ancient Masters
didn't try to educate the people,
but kindly taught them to not-know.

When they think that they know the answers,
people are difficult to guide.
When they know that they don't know,
people can find their own way.

If you want to learn how to govern,
avoid being clever or rich.
The simplest pattern is the clearest.
Content with an ordinary life,
you can show all people the way
back to their own true nature. </p>
<p id="t1d66">All streams flow to the sea
because it is lower than they are.
Humility gives it its power.

If you want to govern the people,
you must place yourself below them.
If you want to lead the people,
you must learn how to follow them.

The Master is above the people,
and no one feels oppressed.
She goes ahead of the people,
and no one feels manipulated.
The whole world is grateful to her.
Because she competes with no one,
no one can compete with her. </p>
<p id="t1d67">Some say that my teaching is nonsense.
Others call it lofty but impractical.
But to those who have looked inside themselves,
this nonsense makes perfect sense.
And to those who put it into practice,
this loftiness has roots that go deep.

I have just three things to teach:
simplicity, patience, compassion.
These three are your greatest treasures.
Simple in actions and in thoughts,
you return to the source of being.
Patient with both friends and enemies,
you accord with the way things are.
Compassionate toward yourself,
you reconcile all beings in the world. </p>
<p id="t1d68">The best athlete
wants his opponent at his best.
The best general
enters the mind of his enemy.
The best businessman
serves the communal good.
The best leader
follows the will of the people.

All of these embody
the virtue of non-competition.
Not that they don't love to compete,
but they do it in the spirit of play.
In this they are like children
and in harmony with the Tao. 
</p>
<p id="t1d69">The generals have a saying:
"Rather than make the first move
it is better to wait and see.
Rather than advance an inch
it is better to retreat a yard."

This is called
going forward without advancing,
pushing back without using weapons.

There is no greater misfortune
than underestimating your enemy.
Underestimating your enemy
means thinking that he is evil.
Thus you destroy your three treasures
and become an enemy yourself.

When two great forces oppose each other,
the victory will go
to the one that knows how to yield.
</p>
<p id="t1d70">My teachings are easy to understand
and easy to put into practice.
Yet your intellect will never grasp them,
and if you try to practice them, you'll fail.

My teachings are older than the world.
How can you grasp their meaning?

If you want to know me,
look inside your heart. </p>
<p id="t1d71">Not-knowing is true knowledge.
Presuming to know is a disease.
First realize that you are sick;
then you can move toward health.

The Master is her own physician.
She has healed herself of all knowing.
Thus she is truly whole. </p>
<p id="t1d72">When they lose their sense of awe,
people turn to religion.
When they no longer trust themselves,
they begin to depend upon authority.

Therefore the Master steps back
so that people won't be confused.
He teaches without a teaching,
so that people will have nothing to learn. </p>
<p id="t1d73">The Tao is always at ease.
It overcomes without competing,
answers without speaking a word,
arrives without being summoned,
accomplishes without a plan.

Its net covers the whole universe.
And though its meshes are wide,
it doesn't let a thing slip through. </p>
<p id="t1d74">If you realize that all things change,
there is nothing you will try to hold on to.
If you aren't afraid of dying,
there is nothing you can't achieve.

Trying to control the future
is like trying to take the master carpenter's place.
When you handle the master carpenter's tools,
chances are that you'll cut your hand. </p>
<p id="t1d75">When taxes are too high,
people go hungry.
When the government is too intrusive,
people lose their spirit.

Act for the people's benefit.
Trust them; leave them alone. </p>
<p id="t1d76">Men are born soft and supple;
dead, they are stiff and hard.
Plants are born tender and pliant;
dead, they are brittle and dry.

Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible
is a disciple of death.
Whoever is soft and yielding
is a disciple of life.

The hard and stiff will be broken.
The soft and supple will prevail. </p>
<p id="t1d77">As it acts in the world, the Tao
is like the bending of a bow.
The top is bent downward;
the bottom is bent up.
It adjusts excess and deficiency
so that there is perfect balance.
It takes from what is too much
and give to what isn't enough.

Those who try to control,
who use force to protect their power,
go against the direction of the Tao.
They take from those who don't have enough
and give to those who have far too much.

The Master can keep giving
because there is no end to her wealth.
She acts without expectation,
succeeds without taking credit,
and doesn't think that she is better
than anyone else. </p>
<p id="t1d78">Nothing in the world
is as soft and yielding as water.
Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible,
nothing can surpass it.

The soft overcomes the hard;
the gentle overcomes the rigid.
Everyone knows this is true,
but few can put it into practice.

Therefore the Master remains
serene in the midst of sorrow.
Evil cannot enter his heart.
Because he has given up helping,
he is people's greatest help.

True words seem paradoxical. </p>
<p id="t1d79">Failure is an opportunity.
If you blame someone else,
there is no end to the blame.

Therefore the Master
fulfills her own obligations
and corrects her own mistakes.
She does what she needs to do
and demands nothing of others. </p>
<p id="t1d80">If a country is governed wisely,
its inhabitants will be content.
They enjoy the labor of their hands
and don't waste time inventing
labor-saving machines.
Since they dearly love their homes,
they aren't interested in travel.
There may be a few wagons and boats,
but these don't go anywhere.
There may be an arsenal of weapons,
but nobody ever uses them.
People enjoy their food,
take pleasure in being with their families,
spend weekends working in their gardens,
delight in the doings of the neighborhood.
And even though the next country is so close
that people can hear its roosters crowing and its dogs barking,
they are content to die of old age
without ever having gone to see it. </p>
<p id="t1d81">True words aren't eloquent;
eloquent words aren't true.
Wise men don't need to prove their point;
men who need to prove their point aren't wise.

The Master has no possessions.
The more he does for others,
the happier he is.
The more he gives to others,
the wealthier he is.

The Tao nourishes by not forcing.
By not dominating, the Master leads.
--
</p>
<p id="t2d01">If you can talk about it,
it ain't Tao.
If it has a name,
it's just another thing.

Tao doesn't have a name.
Names are for ordinary things.

Stop wanting stuff; 
it keeps you from seeing what's real.
When you want stuff, 
all you see are things.

Those two sentences 
mean the same thing.
Figure them out, 
and you've got it made.</p>
<p id="t2d02">If something looks beautiful to you, 
something else must be ugly.
If something seems good, 
something else must seem bad.

You can't have
something without nothing.
If no job is difficult, 
then no job is easy.
Some things are up high 
because other things are down low.
You know you're listening to music 
because it doesn't sound like noise.
All that came first, 
so this must be next.

The Masters get the job done 
without moving a muscle
and get their point across 
without saying a word.

When things around them fall apart, 
they stay cool.
They don't own much, 
but they use whatever's at hand.
They do the work 
without expecting any favors.
When they're done, 
they move on to the next job.
That's why their work is so damn good.</p>
<p id="t2d03">If you toss compliments around freely,
people will waste your time 
trying to impress you.
If you give things too much value,
you're going to get ripped off.
If you try to please people,
you'll just make them pissed.

The Master leads
by clearing the crap 
out of people's heads
and opening their hearts.
He lowers their aspirations
and makes them suck in their guts.

He shows you how to forget 
what you know and what you want,
so nobody can push you around.
If you think you've got the answers, 
he'll mess with your head.

Stop doing stuff all the time, 
and watch what happens.</p>
<p id="t2d04">How much Tao is there?
More than you'll ever need.
Use all you want,
there's plenty more 
where that came from.

You can't see Tao, but it's there.
Damned if I know where it came from.
It's just always been around.</p>
<p id="t2d05">Tao's neutral:
it doesn't worry about good or evil.
The Masters are neutral:
they treat everyone the same.

Lao Tzu said Tao is like a bellows:
It's empty, 
but it could help set the world on fire.
If you keep using Tao, it works better.
If you keep talking about it, 
it won't make any sense.

Be cool.</p>
<p id="t2d06">Tao is an eternal mystery,
and everything starts with Tao.

Everybody has Tao in them.
They just have to use it.</p>
<p id="t2d07">Tao never stops. Why? 
Because it isn't trying to accomplish anything.

The Masters hang back.
That's why they're ahead of the game.

They don't hang on to things.
That's how they manage to keep them.

They don't worry 
about what they can't control.
That's why they're always satisfied.</p>
<p id="t2d08">"Doing the right thing" is like water.
It's good for all living things,and flows without thinking about where it's going

...just like Tao.

Keep your feet on the ground.
Remember what's important.
Be there when people need you.
Say what you mean.
Be prepared for anything.
Do whatever you can, 
whenever it needs doing.

If you don't 
compare yourself to others,
nobody can compare to you.</p>
<p id="t2d09">If you drink too much, you get drunk.
The engine won't start 
if you're always tinkering with it.

If you hoard wealth,
you fall into its clutches.
If you crave success,
you succumb to failure.

Do what you have to do, 
then walk away.
Anything else will drive you nuts.
</p>
<p id="t2d10">Can you hold on to your ego
and still stay focused on Tao?

Can you relax your mind and body
and brace yourself for a new life?

Can you check yourself
and see past 
what's in front of your eyes?

Can you be a leader
and not try to prove you're in charge?

Can you deal with what's happening
and let it happen?

Can you forget what you know
and understand what's real?

Start a job and see it through.
Have things 
without holding on to them.
Do the job 
without expectation of reward.
Lead people 
without giving orders.
That's the way you do it.</p>
<p id="t2d11">A wheel has spokes,
but it rotates around a hollow center.

A pot is made out of clay or glass,
but you keep things in the space inside.

A house is made of wood or brick,
but you live between the walls.

We work with something,
but we use nothing.</p>
<p id="t2d12">Sight obscures.
Noise deafens.

Desire messes with your heart.
The world messes with your mind.

A Master watches the world
but keeps focused on what's real.</p>
<p id="t2d13">Winning can be just as bad as losing.
Confidence can mess you up 
just as much as fear.

What does 
"winning can be just as bad as losing" mean?

If you're down,
you might be able to get up.
But if you're up, 
you can get knocked down real fast.
Don't worry about the score,
just do what you have to do.

What does 
"confidence can mess you up 
just as much as fear" mean?

Fear can keep you 
from getting the job done,
but confidence 
can get you in over your head.
Walk tall, but don't get cocky.

Know your limits, 
and nothing can ever hold you back.
Deal with what you can. 
The rest will follow.</p>
<p id="t2d14">You can't see Tao, 
no matter how hard you look.
You can't hear Tao, 
no matter how hard you listen.
You can't hold on to Tao, 
no matter how hard you grab.

But it's there.

It's in you, and it's all around you.

Remember that.</p>
<p id="t2d15">The ancient Masters 
were damn impressive.
They were deep. Real deep.
Words can't even begin to describe 
how deep they were.
You can only talk 
about how they acted.

They were careful, 
like a man walking on thin ice.
They were cautious, 
like a soldier behind enemy lines.
They were polite,
like a guest at a party.
They moved quickly, like melting ice. 
They were as plain as a block of wood.
Their minds were as wide as a valley,
and their hearts as clear 
as spring water.

Can you wait 
for that kind of openness and clarity
before you try to understand the world?

Can you hold still
until events have unfolded
before you do the right thing?

When you act without expectations,
you can accomplish great things.</p>
<p id="t2d16">Keep your head clear.
Stay calm.
Watch 
as everything happens around you.

Everything reverts 
to its original state, 
which was nothing.
And when something becomes nothing, 
it gets right with Tao.

If you don't understand that,
you're going to screw up 
somewhere down the line.
If you figure it out,
you'll always know what to do.

If you get right with Tao,
you won't be afraid to die,
because you know you will.</p>
<p id="t2d17">When a Master takes charge,
hardly anybody notices.
The next best leader 
is obeyed out of love.
After that, 
there's the leader obeyed out of fear.
The worst leader is one who is hated.

Trust and respect people.
That's how you earn 
their trust and respect.

The Masters don't give orders;
they work with everybody else.
When the job's done,
people are amazed 
at what they accomplished.</p>
<p id="t2d18">When people lose touch with Tao,
they start talking about 
"righteousness" and "sanctity."

When people forget what's true,
they start talking about 
"self-evident truths."

When people have no respect
for one another,
they start talking about 
"political correctness" 
and "family values."

When the nation is unstable,
people start talking about "patriotism."</p>
<p id="t2d19">Get rid of sanctity.
People will understand the truth 
and be happier.

Get rid of morality.
People will respect each other 
and do what's right.

Get rid of value and profit.
People will not steal
if they do not desire.

If that's not possible, go to Plan B:
Be simple. Be real.
Do your work as best you can. 
Don't think about what you get for it.
Stay focused. Get rid of all your crap.</p>
<p id="t2d20">Don't spend too much time 
thinking about stupid shit.
Why should you care
if people agree or disagree with you?
Why should you care 
if others find you attractive or not?
Why should you care 
about things that worry others?
Call bullshit on all that.

Let other people 
get worked up 
and try to enjoy themselves.
I'm not going to give myself away.
A baby doesn't know how to smile, 
but it's still happy.

Let other people
get excited about stuff.
I'm not going to hang on to anything.
I'm not going to fill my mind with ideas.
I'm not going to get stuck in a rut, 
tied down to any one place.

Other people are clever;
I guess I must be stupid.
Other people have goals;
I guess I must be aimless.
Like the wind. Or the waves.

I'm not like other people.
I'm getting right with Tao.</p>
<p id="t2d21">A Master stays focused on Tao.
Nothing else, just Tao.

But you can't pin Tao down--
you can't even see it!
How are you supposed to focus on something like that?

Just remember what Lao Tzu said: 
The universe began as a void.
The void fills with images.
Images lead to the creation of objects.
And every object has Tao at its core.

That's the way it's been, 
ever since the world began.
How can I be so sure?
I just know.</p>
<p id="t2d22">Learn how to stand still 
if you want to go places.
Get on your knees
if you want to stand tall.
If you want wisdom, 
empty your mind.
If you want the world, 
renounce your riches.
Push yourself until you're exhausted, 
and then you'll find your strength.

You can go far
if you don't have anything to carry.
The more you acquire,
the less you can really see.

A Master takes this to heart
and sets an example 
for everybody else.

She doesn't show off
so people take notice.
She's not out to prove anything
so people take her at her word.
She doesn't brag about herself
but people know what she's done.
She hasn't got an agenda
but people know what she can do.
She's not out to get anybody
so nobody can get in her way.

"Learn how to stand still 
if you want to go places."
That's not as crazy as it sounds.
Get in touch with Tao,
and you'll see what I mean.</p>
<p id="t2d23">When you have nothing to say,
you may as well keep your mouth shut.
The wind and the rain 
don't go on forever.
If nature knows enough 
to give it a rest sometimes,
so should you.

If you're ready for Tao,
    you can live with Tao.
If you're ready to succeed,
you can live with success.
If you're ready to fail, 
you can live with failure.

Trust your instincts, 
and others will trust you.</p>
<p id="t2d24">Keep your feet firmly planted
unless you want to fall on your face.
Learn how to pace yourself 
if you want to get anywhere.
Don't call attention to yourself 
if you want people to notice your work.

Nobody respects people 
who always have excuses.
Nobody gives credit to people 
who always take it.
People who hype themselves 
have nothing else to offer.

Think of being in touch with Tao 
like eating at a buffet:
Take only what you need.
Save some for everybody else.</p>
<p id="t2d25">Something perfect
has existed forever,
even longer than the universe.
It's a vast, unchanging void.
There's nothing else like it.
It goes on forever and never stops,
and everything else came from it.

I don't know what else to call it 
so I'll call it Tao.
What's it like?
I can tell you this much: it's great.

So great that it endures.
Something that endures 
goes a long way.
And something that goes a long way 
always comes back to the beginning.

Tao's great.
Heaven's great.
Earth's great. 
And someone in touch with Tao
is great, too.
Those are the four greatest things
in the universe.
    
Someone who's in touch with Tao 
is in touch with the earth.
The earth is in touch with heaven.
Heaven's in touch with Tao.
Tao's in touch with the way things are.</p>
<p id="t2d26">To be light on your feet, 
you need a steady mind.
If your body is active, 
your mind should be relaxed.

A Master can travel long distances 
and still see everything she owns.
She may be surrounded by beauty
but she isn't caught up in it.

Why run around thoughtlessly?
If you act lightly,
you lose your bearings.
If you act recklessly,
you lose your self-control.</p>
<p id="t2d27">With enough practice,
you could come and go without a trace,
speak without stumbling over words,
do complicated math problems 
in your head.

You could build a door with no lock 
that nobody could open.
You could tie something down 
with no knots, 
without even a rope,
and nobody could pry it loose.

Masters have time to help everybody, 
and ignore nobody.
They use their resources wisely, 
wasting nothing.
Some people call this 
"following the light."

Good people teach others 
because they have the potential 
to be good too.
Brains count for nothing
if you fail to respect your teachers
or to honor the potential in others.
That's one of the most important lessons of Tao.</p>
<p id="t2d28">If you are strong, 
but remain sensitive, 
power will flow through you.
With that power, 
you'll always be right with Tao:
It's like a whole new life.

If you are idealistic, 
but stay rooted in reality, 
you are an example to others.
Set that example, 
and you'll always be right with Tao:
There is no limit to what you can do.

If you are honorable, 
but remain humble, 
you will see things as they are.
If you see things as they are, 
you'll always be right with Tao:
Your life will become simple, 
yet full of potential.

Let Tao show you 
how to get right with Tao,
so your slightest gesture 
can change the world.</p>
<p id="t2d29">Want to take over the world?
Think again.
The world's a holy place.
You can't just fuck around with it.
Those who try to change it destroy it.
Those who try to possess it lose it.

With Tao, you push forward, 
or maybe you stay behind.
Sometimes you push yourself, 
other times you rest.
Sometimes you're strong, 
sometimes you're weak.
Sometimes you're up, 
and sometimes you're down.

A Master lives simply, 
avoiding extravagance and excess.</p>
<p id="t2d30">Listen up:
If you want to be a leader 
who's in touch with Tao,
never use violence 
to achieve your goals.

Every act of violence backfires.
An army on the move 
leaves a trail of tears,
and a military victory 
always lies in ruins.

The Masters do what needs doing 
and that's all they do.
Do what you have to do 
without arrogance or pride.
Get the job done 
and don't brag about it afterwards.
Do what you have to do, 
not for your own benefit,
but because it needs to be done.
And don't do it the way
you think it should be done,
do it the way it needs to be done.

The mighty will always lose their power 
and any connection 
they ever had to Tao.
They will not last long;
if you're not right with Tao, 
you might as well be dead.</p>
<p id="t2d31">Weapons are terrible things.
If you want to get right with Tao,
reject weapons.

The Master, 
knowing all things came from Tao,
recognizes what he has in common 
with his enemies
and always tries to avoid conflict.

But when there is no other choice,
he uses force reluctantly.
He does so with great restraint,
and never celebrates a victory;
to do so would be to rejoice in killing.
A person who would rejoice in killing
has completely lost touch with Tao.

When you win a war, 
you preside over a funeral.
Pay your respects to the dead.</p>
<p id="t2d32">Tao is an eternal mystery,
so small you can never take hold of it.

If a leader gets right with Tao,
people will follow him on instinct.
All will be right with the world.
People will do the right thing 
without being told.

Everything that comes from Tao 
needs a name.
But once everything has its name, 
you should make no other distinction between things.
This prevents you
from becoming trapped by them.

Everything in the universe is full of Tao 
and leads to Tao,
just like the water in rivers 
that flows into oceans.</p>
<p id="t2d33">Knowing things makes you smart,
but knowing yourself makes you wise.
To rule others, you must be powerful,
but to rule yourself, 
you must be strong.

If you have only what you need, 
you have true wealth.
If you never give up, 
you will find a way.
If you stay true to yourself,
you will never be lost.
If you stay alive your whole life,
you've really lived.</p>
<p id="t2d34">Tao flows in all directions.
It's in everything, 
but nothing can contain it.
Everything needs Tao,
so Tao provides,
and never expects anything in return.

Everything comes from Tao,
but Tao doesn't call attention to itself.
It wants for nothing. 
Think nothing of it.

Everything leads to Tao,
but Tao doesn't call attention to itself.
Pretty impressive, huh?

It doesn't strive for success. 
That's why it succeeds.</p>
<p id="t2d35">When you get right with Tao, 
everybody wants to be your friend.
When they're around you, 
they can relax and enjoy themselves.

People can be easily distracted 
by music or good food.
When we try to talk about Tao, 
it seems boring by comparison.

It doesn't look like much.
It doesn't sound like much.
But no matter how much you use, 
there's still plenty left.</p>
<p id="t2d36">To make something smaller,
you need to appreciate its size.
To make something weaker,
you must recognize its strength.
To get rid of something,
you need to hold it tight.
To take something,
you must give it up entirely.

To put it another way:
Sensitivity and weakness 
overcome unfeeling strength.</p>
<p id="t2d37">Tao never does anything 
but nothing is left undone.

If our leaders 
could get in touch with Tao,
the world would take care of itself.
Even if they wanted 
to impose their own ideas,
they'd be drawn back to Tao's 
nameless simplicity.

When our lives are that simple, 
we want for nothing.
We can relax, 
and the world becomes a better place.</p>
<p id="t2d38">People with integrity 
don't even think about it.
That's how you can tell 
they have integrity.
Other people talk about 
how much integrity they have,
when they really don't have much. 
If any.

Truly powerful people 
don't do anything, 
but they get the job done.
Other people are always busy 
doing something,
but nothing ever gets done.

When kind people act,
they do so without thinking about it.
When the just act,
they're always sure 
they're doing the right thing.
But when the righteous act, 
and nobody reacts,
they try to force everyone 
to do things their way.

If you're not in touch with Tao, 
at least you can still have integrity.
If you don't have integrity, 
there's always kindness.
If you don't have kindness, 
there's always justice.
If you don't have justice,
all you have left is righteousness.

Righteousness is an pale imitation 
of true faith and loyalty,
and always leads to trouble.
If you've already made up your mind,
you don't know the first thing about Tao, 
and you never will.

The Masters pay attention 
to what's beneath the surface.
They'll look at a tree's leaves, 
but eat the fruit.
They turn all that down, 
so they can accept this.</p>
<p id="t2d39">Since time began, 
this is what it's meant 
to be in touch with Tao:

Tao made the heavens clear.
Tao made the earth solid.
Tao made our spirits strong.
Tao made the valleys fertile.
Tao gave all living things life.
Tao gave rulers authority.

Without Tao, 
the heavens would collapse.
Without Tao,
the earth would crumble.
Without Tao, 
our spirits would fade away.
Without Tao, 
the valleys would dry up.
Without Tao, 
all life would become extinct.
Without Tao, 
rulers would stumble and fall.

Humility gives us power.
Our leaders should think of themselves 
as insignificant, powerless, 
unworthy of their stature.
Isn't that what humility is all about?

Be strong, 
but pay no attention to hollow praise.
Don't call attention to yourself. 
Don't make a scene.</p>
<p id="t2d40">Tao is always heading 
back to where it came from.
Tao advances by not pressing forward.

Things exist because they are.
They are because they once were not.</p>
<p id="t2d41">When a wise person hears about Tao, 
he gets right with it.
When an ordinary person 
hears about Tao,
he tries to get right with it, 
but eventually gives up.
When a fool hears about Tao, 
he just laughs and laughs.
If he didn't laugh, it wouldn't be Tao.

Here's what they find so funny:
The path to enlightenment 
seems covered in shadows.
The way forward
    feels like taking a step back.
The easiest path seems difficult.
Those with the most virtue 
seem debased.
Those who are most pure 
seem to be grubby and soiled.
The deepest thoughts appear shallow.
The greatest strength
looks like weakness.
What is most real 
strikes us as imaginary.
The largest space has no boundaries.
The greatest talent 
seems to produce nothing.
The greatest voice is unhearable.
The greatest beauty is invisible.

Tao is hidden to us
and it has no name.
It is the source and the strength of all things.</p>
<p id="t2d42">Chapter 42 starts out 
with some cosmic mumbo-jumbo
about Tao making one, 
one making two,
two making three, 
and three making everything else.

I don't know what it means,
and, frankly,
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

Let's get to the practical part:
Men hate to be called 
powerless, insignificant, or unworthy,
but that's how 
Masters describe themselves.

Because when we lose, we've won.
And when we succeed, we've failed.

Other people will tell you 
what I'm telling you now:
"Live by the sword, die by the sword."
That's pretty much what Chapter 42
boils down to.
(See Chapter 46 for more details.)</p>
<p id="t2d43">The softest force in the universe
can overcome the hardest of objects.
Something without substance
can pass through the space between atoms.

That's how I know 
about the power of doing nothing.

The silent teachings 
and the power of doing nothing
can only be understood 
by a few people.</p>
<p id="t2d44">What's more important,
fame or your well-being?
What's worth more,
your money or your life?
What is more dangerous,
winning or losing?

If you are too attached 
to your possessions,
they will bring you misery.
If you hang on to your riches,
you will suffer substantial loss.
If you know when you have enough,
you will never be disgraced.
If you practice moderation,
you can stay out of trouble.

And that's the secret to lasting success.</p>
<p id="t2d45">The greatest achievements 
may look like mistakes,
but you will always be able 
to build upon them.

The fullest reserves may seem empty,
but you will always be able 
to draw upon them.

The straightest line looks crooked.
The most skilled people 
come off as clumsy.
The most eloquent people 
are usually silent.

When it's cold, 
you can move around to stay warm.
When it's hot, 
you should keep still and stay cool.
But whatever the weather, 
if you stay calm,
the world will sort itself out around you.</p>
<p id="t2d46">"When the world is right with Tao," 
Lao Tzu said,
"horses haul fertilizer to the fields.
When the world loses touch with Tao,
horses are trained for cavalry."

Nothing is more insidious than possession.
Nothing is more dangerous than desire.
Nothing is more disastrous than greed.

If you know when enough is enough,
you will always have enough.</p>
<p id="t2d47">You don't have to leave your room
to understand what's happening in the world.

You don't have to look out the window
to appreciate the beauty of heaven.

The farther you wander,
the less you know.

The Masters don't wander around
They know.
They don't just look. 
They understand.
They don't do anything, 
but the work gets done.</p>
<p id="t2d48">Usually, 
we try to learn something new every day.

But if we want to get right with Tao,
we have to let go of something every day.

We do less and less, 
until we end up doing nothing.
And it's when we do nothing
that we get the job done.

Let events take their course, 
and everything will turn out
in your favor.
If you act on your ambitions, 
they will never pan out.</p>
<p id="t2d49">The Masters 
don't make up their minds.
They turn their thoughts
to other people.

They are good to good people, 
and they're good to bad people.
This is real goodness.

They have faith in the faithful, 
and they have faith in the unfaithful.
This is real faith.

A Master throws himself 
into the world completely,
forgetting everything he's been told.
People pay attention to him
because he lives a life of child-like wonder.</p>
<p id="t2d50">People who look 
for the secret of long life 
wind up dead.

Their bodies are the focus of their lives
and the source of their death,
because they think a healthy body
is all there is to life.

Lao Tzu used to say 
a man who truly understood life
could walk through the jungle 
without fear
or across a battlefield 
without armor, totally unarmed.
Wild animals and weapons couldn't kill him.

I know, I know: 
what the hell does that mean?
"Well, he couldn't be killed," 
Lao Tzu said,
"because his body 
wasn't where he kept his death."</p>
<p id="t2d51">Tao is the source of all living things,
and they are nourished 
by Tao's power.
They are influenced 
by the other living things around them,
and they are shaped 
by their circumstances.

Everything respects Tao
and honors its power.
That's just the way it is.

Tao gives life to all things, 
and its power watches out for them,
cares for them, helps them grow, 
protects them, and comforts them.

Create something 
without holding on to it.
Do the work 
without expecting credit for it.
Lead people 
without giving them orders.
That's the secret of the power of Tao.</p>
<p id="t2d52">Everything starts with Tao,
the mother of all things.
If you know the mother,
you know the children.
If you know the children 
and remember the mother,
you have nothing to fear in your life.

Shut your mouth and keep still,
and your life will be full of happiness.
If you talk all the time,
always doing something,
your life will be hopeless.

It takes insight to see subtlety.
It takes strength 
to yield gently to force.
Use that strength 
to hang on to your insight,
and you will always be at peace.
That's how to get right with Tao.</p>
<p id="t2d53">If I had any sense,
I'd be trying to get right with Tao,
and the only thing I'd worry about 
would be messing up.
It's not that hard to get right with Tao,
but people are easily distracted.

"When the king's palace is full of treasure," 
Lao Tzu said,
"ordinary people's fields 
are smothered with weeds,
and the food supplies run out."

Today, you see sharply dressed people
carrying flashy weapons 
and living the high life.

They own more 
than they could ever use, 
let alone need.

They're nothing 
but gangsters and crooks.
That's not what Tao's about.</p>
<p id="t2d54">Tao's power is so deeply entrenched 
it can never be uprooted.
Tao's power clings so tightly
it can never slip away.
It will endure for generations.

If you get in touch 
with the power of Tao,
it will become real.
If your family gets in touch 
with the power of Tao,
the power will flourish.

If your community gets in touch 
with the power of Tao,
the power will grow even stronger.
If your country gets in touch 
with the power of Tao,
the power will become abundant.

If the world gets in touch 
with the power of Tao,
the power will be everywhere.

How can I know this?
I just do.</p>
<p id="t2d55">A person filled with the power of Tao 
is like a baby boy:
bees can't sting him, 
wild beasts can't attack him.

A baby has soft bones 
and weak muscles, 
but a firm grip.
He hasn't had sex, 
but he can get an erection.
That's because he's got lots of energy.
He can cry all day
and never lose his voice.
That's because he's at one with his world.

If you're at one with the world, 
you know constancy.
And if you know constancy, 
you've been enlightened.

It's not healthy 
to try to prolong your life.
It's unnatural to impose the mind's will 
upon the body.
People waste time and energy
trying to be strong or beautiful,
and their strength and beauty fade.
They've lost touch with Tao,
and when you lose touch with Tao,
you might as well be dead.</p>
<p id="t2d56">Those who know, don't talk.
Those who talk, don't know.

Shut your mouth.
Be still. Relax.
Let go of your worries.
Stay out of the spotlight.
Be at one with the world 
and get right with Tao.

If you get right with Tao,
you won't be worried 
about praise or scorn,
about winning or losing,
about honor or disgrace.
That's the way to be.</p>
<p id="t2d57">You can run a country 
by sticking to principles,
and you can win a war 
with strategy and tactics.
But you can gain the entire world 
by doing nothing at all.

How do I know this?
I've seen it happen:
The more restrictions 
a nation imposes,
the poorer its people become.
When a nation hoards weapons,
troubles arise from within 
and from without.
When its leaders try 
to be cunning and clever,
the situation spins 
further out of control.
When they try to fix things
by passing more laws,
they only increase the number of outlaws.

A wise leader says to himself:
"I do nothing, 
and people transform themselves.
I keep silent, 
and they do the right thing 
on their own.
I stay out of the way, 
and they prosper.
I want for nothing, 
and they lead simple lives."</p>
<p id="t2d58">When a nation is ruled 
with a light touch, 
people lead simple lives.
When a government
is harsh and demanding,
people will spend their time 
trying to outsmart it.

Happiness is rooted in misery, 
and misery lurks beneath all joy.
Who knows what could happen tomorrow?

Everything is relative; 
what's considered proper today 
may become improper.
Correct appearances 
may hide dishonesty and sinfulness.

No wonder so many people get confused.

The Masters have sharp minds, 
not sharp tongues.
They are austere, 
but never judgmental.
They are straightforward, 
but not provocative.
They are brilliant, 
but not flashy.</p>
<p id="t2d59">Leadership is based on moderation.
Practice moderation, 
and you'll get in touch 
with the power of Tao.

If you get right with Tao, 
nothing is impossible.
If you get right with Tao, 
there's no limit to what you can do.
If you get right with Tao,
you can be a true leader.

Remember this advice 
if you want to be a leader:
Plant deep roots in firm soil.
Get right with Tao,
and you'll always see things clearly.</p>
<p id="t2d60">Being a leader
is like cooking a small fish;
get right with Tao, 
and it's quick and easy.

When you're in touch with Tao,
you don't need to worry 
about misfortune.
You can't make it go away, of course,
but you can keep it 
from harming other people.

Also, as a wise leader, 
you cause no harm to others,
so people won't have to worry 
about getting hurt,
and they'll take the opportunity 
to do the right thing.</p>
<p id="t2d61">Power flows down
to every level of existence
like a river to the ocean.

Victory comes 
from lying perfectly still
and waiting for power 
to come your way.

If you yield to someone 
less powerful than yourself,
you will be in a position 
to influence them.

If you submit to someone 
more powerful than yourself,
you create an opportunity 
to get your own way.

So if you want to get ahead, 
lay low and bide your time.
That way, everybody's happy.</p>
<p id="t2d62">Every living thing 
gets its strength from Tao.
Good people respect the value of Tao.
The wicked and foolish don't,
but Tao provides for them anyway.

Some people gain power and prestige through fancy words,
others through great deeds.
But Tao is available to everyone, 
not just the powerful.
So don't look down on anybody.

When people become powerful,
and everybody lines up 
to kiss their ass,
sit still and stay right with Tao.

Why have the Masters 
always respected Tao?
Because when you get right with Tao,
you can always find 
what you need to get by,
and trouble can never find you.</p>
<p id="t2d63">Keep still.
Don't work so hard.
Learn to appreciate everyday life.
Pay attention to details.
Start small and work your way up.
When people give you trouble, 
let it slide.

Break everything down to its essentials.
Get the job done 
before it becomes a chore.

With the right preparation,
difficult tasks 
can be completed with ease;
every major project 
consists of simple steps.

The Masters don't take on 
more than they can handle,
which is why 
they can do just about anything.

Don't promise 
more than you can deliver,
and don't underestimate the task:
You'll only make things harder for yourself.

The Masters are always aware 
of the difficulties involved,
which is why 
they never have to deal with them.</p>
<p id="t2d64">It's easy to maintain balance.
Trouble can be nipped in the bud.
Fragile things break easily, 
and small things are easy to lose.

Deal with the situation 
before it becomes a problem.
Keep everything straight 
so it can't get messed up.

Every tree was once a seed.
Every skyscraper started out 
with a shovelful of dirt.
And--stop me if you've heard this one before--
a journey of a thousand miles 
begins with a single step.

When you try too hard, 
you defeat your own purpose.
Cling to stuff,
and you will suffer loss.
The Masters make no effort, 
so they never fail.
They aren't attached to things,
so they never feel loss.

People often screw up 
when the job's nearly done.
Pay as much attention 
to the finishing touches 
as you do to the initial steps,
and you won't screw up like that.

The Masters try to be free from desire.
They don't collect precious things.
They don't cling to any beliefs.
They pay attention 
to what everybody else ignores.
They help the world get right with Tao,
but don't try to change a thing.</p>
<p id="t2d65">In ancient times, 
leaders who were right with Tao
didn't teach everybody 
how to become enlightened.
They kept people's lives simple.

People who know too much 
can't be taught anything.
Leaders who try to be clever 
always screw things up.
Leaders who keep things simple
always make things right.

If you get that,
you'll understand
the mysterious power of Tao.

That kind of power is so deep, 
so extensive,
it penetrates into every level of existence.</p>
<p id="t2d66">An ocean is greater 
than the hundred rivers 
that flow into it,
and all it does is wait 
to receive what they bring.

If you want to teach people, 
don't talk down to them.
If you want to lead them, 
find out where they want to go.

People love leaders 
who make them feel safe 
without smothering them.
They'll always support 
a leader like that,
and because he doesn't try 
to compete with anybody,
nobody is able to compete with him.</p>
<p id="t2d67">Everywhere I go, people tell me,
"Tao is so powerful, so immense, 
it's inconceivable!"

But it's only powerful 
because it's inconceivable.
If we could wrap our minds around it,
Tao would be just another thing.

The three most important qualities in life 
are compassion, 
or showing kindness and mercy to others, 
moderation, 
or knowing what a thing is worth, 
and modesty, 
or knowing your place in the world.

Courage stems from showing
kindness and mercy to others.
Generosity starts with knowing 
what a thing is worth.
True leadership begins with knowing 
your place in the world.

But these days,
I see everyone trying to act courageous 
without any trace of compassion.
They try to be generous
but they don't practice moderation
in their own lives.
They act like leaders, 
but they have no sense of modesty.
No good can come of this.

If you want to get ahead, 
show people compassion.
When other people attack you,
defend yourself with compassion.
It's the most powerful force in the universe.</p>
<p id="t2d68">A true warrior never uses force
with an attitude of pride or anger.
A true victor 
does not pursue vengeance.
A true leader shows humility.

This is the power of modesty.
It's the best way to deal with people.
It's always been an excellent way
to get right with Tao.</p>
<p id="t2d69">There's an old military saying:
"I'd rather face an attack 
than have to make one.
I'd rather retreat a foot 
than try to advance an inch."

That's the secret to moving forward 
while staying put,
preparing for battle 
without revealing your strength.

When you defend yourself 
without any show of force,
you give your opponent 
nothing to fight.

Attacking an enemy 
you've underestimated 
is a costly mistake.
When two forces oppose each other,
the winner is the one most reluctant to fight.</p>
<p id="t2d70">Lao Tzu's advice 
was easy to understand 
and easy to follow.
But nobody understood him 
or did what he suggested.

His words 
stemmed from ancient wisdom,
and his actions were highly disciplined.
People didn't get that,
which is why 
they didn't understand him.
And the less they understood him,
the more meaningful his advice became.

That's why the Masters live simply,
hiding their wisdom deep within themselves.</p>
<p id="t2d71">If you know 
what you don't know, 
you're doing great.
If you don't know 
what you don't know, 
you're sick.

The only way
to get rid of that sickness 
is to be sick of it.

The Masters aren't sick,
because they got sick of being sick.</p>
<p id="t2d72">When you show no fear at all,
the universe gives you something
to really be afraid of.

Don't try to fence people in 
or grind them down.
Just let them be, 
and they'll always be on your side.

The Masters know themselves, 
but they don't reveal themselves.
They love themselves,
but they know 
what their lives are worth.
They let go of all that 
to concentrate on this.</p>
<p id="t2d73">Those who dare to be bold die.
Those who dare to be careful survive.
So--what do you want to do?

Why is life like that, you ask?
I don't know.

This is how Tao works:
It doesn't push itself, 
and it always succeeds.
It acts silently, and it always reacts.
It can't be summoned; 
it comes whenever it's ready.
It can't be rushed; it's always on time.

"Heaven casts a wide net, 
with big holes,"
Lao Tzu used to say, 
"but nothing ever gets by it."</p>
<p id="t2d74">If people's lives suck, 
and they look forward to death,
what good does it do 
to threaten to kill them?

If people are afraid to die, 
and the wicked are condemned to death,
then who would dare to commit evil?

But that doesn't mean you or I 
can just take life and death 
into our own hands.
That'd be like walking up 
to an industrial buzzsaw 
and trying to use it 
without any training.
We'd only end up hurting ourselves.</p>
<p id="t2d75">People starve 
because the government 
taxes them to death.
People rebel 
because the government 
tries to run their lives.
People act like life is meaningless
because the government 
takes everything they have.

People who know how to enjoy life
are wiser than people who value their lives.</p>
<p id="t2d76">A baby's body is soft and gentle.
A corpse is hard and stiff.
Plants and trees are tender 
and full of sap.
Dead leaves are brittle and dry.

If you are rigid and unyielding,
you might as well be dead.
If you are soft and flexible, 
you are truly alive.

Soldiers trained to fight to the death will die.
A tree that cannot bend with the wind 
will snap.

Here's a useful saying:
The harder they come, 
the harder they fall.

Here's another:
The meek shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p id="t2d77">Lao Tzu said using Tao 
was like pulling on a bowstring:
The top bends down, 
the bottom bends up,
and all the energy 
is focused in the middle.

Tao takes energy from where it is,
and sends it where it needs to be.
But most people take from those 
who don't have enough,
so those who have too much already 
can have more.

So who in this world 
is truly generous to others?
People who are in touch with Tao.
They do their work 
without taking credit.
They get the job done and move on.
They aren't interested in showing off.</p>
<p id="t2d78">Nothing is softer 
or more yielding 
than water.
Yet, given time, 
it can erode even the hardest stone.
That's how the weak 
can defeat the strong, 
and the supple 
can win out over the stiff.

Everybody knows it.
So why don't we apply it to our own lives?

Lao Tzu used to say:
"Take on people's problems, 
and you can be their leader.
Deal with the world's problems, 
and you'll be a Master."

Sometimes the truth makes no sense.</p>
<p id="t2d79">Sometimes, 
when an argument is settled,
feelings of resentment still remain 
on either side.
What's the point of carrying a grudge?

The Masters care 
about what they owe other people,
not what other people owe them.

People who are in touch with Tao 
do their duty.
People who aren't 
try to force others into submission.

Tao doesn't play favorites.
But if you do right by Tao,
Tao will do right by you.</p>
<p id="t2d80">Lao Tzu had a dream
about a small country 
with very few people.

They didn't need machines 
to get their work done faster.
They took their lives seriously, 
and stayed close to home.

They may have owned 
boats and carriages,
but they never went anywhere.
They may have owned weapons,
but they kept those weapons 
locked up, securely hidden.
They had so few responsibilities,
they never had to make a To-Do list
to remember what had to be done.

They enjoyed simple foods, 
dressed plainly,
lived comfortably, 
and kept their traditions alive.

And even though 
their neighbors were so close
they could hear
the dogs barking at night,
they had no interest 
in leaving their homes,
where they grew old peacefully 
and died.</p>
<p id="t2d81">The truth isn't flashy.
Flashy words aren't true.

Educated people 
aren't always smart.
Smart people 
don't always have an education.

Good people don't argue.
People who argue aren't good.

The Masters don't hang on to things.
They're always doing something 
for other people,
so they always have more to give.
They give away 
whatever they have,
so what they have is worth more.

If you want to get right with Tao,
help other people, don't hurt them.
The Masters always work with people, 
never against them.</p>
<p id="t3d01">The tao that can be described  
is not the eternal Tao.  
The name that can be spoken  
is not the eternal Name.  
The nameless is the boundary of Heaven and Earth.  
The named is the mother of creation.  

Freed from desire, you can see the hidden mystery.  
By having desire, you can only see what is visibly real.  

Yet mystery and reality  
emerge from the same source.  
This source is called darkness.  

Darkness born from darkness.  
The beginning of all understanding.  

</p>
<p id="t3d02">When people see things as beautiful,  
ugliness is created.  
When people see things as good,  
evil is created.  

Being and non-being produce each other.  
Difficult and easy complement each other.  
Long and short define each other.  
High and low oppose each other.  
Fore and aft follow each other.  

Therefore the Master  
can act without doing anything  
and teach without saying a word.  
Things come her way and she does not stop them;  
things leave and she lets them go.  
She has without possessing,  
and acts without any expectations.  
When her work is done, she take no credit.  
That is why it will last forever.  

</p>
<p id="t3d03">If you overly esteem talented individuals,  
people will become overly competitive.  
If you overvalue possessions,  
people will begin to steal.  

Do not display your treasures  
or people will become envious.  

The Master leads by  
emptying people's minds,  
filling their bellies,  
weakening their ambitions,  
and making them become strong.  
Preferring simplicity and freedom from desires,  
avoiding the pitfalls of knowledge and wrong action.  

For those who practice not-doing,  
everything will fall into place.  

</p>
<p id="t3d04">The Tao is like an empty container:  
it can never be emptied and can never be filled.  
Infinitely deep, it is the source of all things.  
It dulls the sharp, unties the knotted,   
shades the lighted, and unites all of creation with dust.  

It is hidden but always present.  
I don't know who gave birth to it.  
It is older than the concept of God.  

</p>
<p id="t3d05">Heaven and Earth are impartial;  
they treat all of creation as straw dogs.  
The Master doesn't take sides;  
she treats everyone like a straw dog.  

The space between Heaven and Earth is like a bellows;  
it is empty, yet has not lost its power.  
The more it is used, the more it produces;  
the more you talk of it, the less you comprehend.  

It is better not to speak of things you do not understand.  

</p>
<p id="t3d06">The spirit of emptiness is immortal.  
It is called the Great Mother  
because it gives birth to Heaven and Earth.  

It is like a vapor,  
barely seen but always present.  
Use it effortlessly.  

</p>
<p id="t3d07">The Tao of Heaven is eternal,   
and the earth is long enduring.  
Why are they long enduring?  
They do not live for themselves;  
thus they are present for all beings.  

The Master puts herself last;  
And finds herself in the place of authority.  
She detaches herself from all things;  
Therefore she is united with all things.  
She gives no thought to self.  
She is perfectly fulfilled.  

</p>
<p id="t3d08">The supreme good is like water,  
which benefits all of creation  
without trying to compete with it.  
It gathers in unpopular places.  
Thus it is like the Tao.  

The location makes the dwelling good.  
Depth of understanding makes the mind good.  
A kind heart makes the giving good.  
Integrity makes the government good.  
Accomplishment makes your labors good.  
Proper timing makes a decision good.  

Only when there is no competition  
will we all live in peace.  

</p>
<p id="t3d09">It is easier to carry an empty cup  
than one that is filled to the brim.  

The sharper the knife  
the easier it is to dull.  
The more wealth you possess  
the harder it is to protect.  
Pride brings its own trouble.  

When you have accomplished your goal  
simply walk away.  
This is the path way to Heaven.  

</p>
<p id="t3d10">Nurture the darkness of your soul  
until you become whole.  
Can you do this and not fail?  
Can you focus your life-breath until you become  
supple as a newborn child?  
While you cleanse your inner vision  
will you be found without fault?  
Can you love people and lead them  
without forcing your will on them?  
When Heaven gives and takes away  
can you be content with the outcome?  
When you understand all things  
can you step back from your own understanding?  

Giving birth and nourishing,  
making without possessing,  
expecting nothing in return.  
To grow, yet not to control:  
This is the mysterious virtue.  

</p>
<p id="t3d11">Thirty spokes are joined together in a wheel,  
but it is the center hole  
that allows the wheel to function.  

We mold clay into a pot,  
but it is the emptiness inside  
that makes the vessel useful.  

We fashion wood for a house,  
but it is the emptiness inside  
that makes it livable.  

We work with the substantial,  
but the emptiness is what we use.  

</p>
<p id="t3d12">Five colors blind the eye.  
Five notes deafen the ear.  
Five flavors make the palate go stale.  
Too much activity deranges the mind.  
Too much wealth causes crime.  

The Master acts on what she feels and not what she sees.  
She shuns the latter, and prefers to seek the former.  

</p>
<p id="t3d13">Success is as dangerous as failure,  
and we are often our own worst enemy.  

What does it mean that success is as dangerous as failure?  
He who is superior is also someone's subordinate.  
Receiving favor and losing it both cause alarm.  
That is what is meant by success is as dangerous as failure.

What does it mean that we are often our own worst enemy?  
The reason I have an enemy is because I have a "self".  
If I no longer had a "self", I would no longer have an enemy.  

Love the whole world as if it were your self;  
then you will truly care for all things.  

</p>
<p id="t3d14">Look for it, and it can't be seen.  
Listen for it, and it can't be heard.  
Grasp for it, and it can't be caught.  
These three cannot be further described,  
so we treat them as The One.  

Its highest is not bright.  
Its depths are not dark.  
Unending, unnameable, it returns to nothingness.  
Formless forms, and imageless images,  
subtle, beyond all understanding.  

Approach it and you will not see a beginning;  
follow it and there will be no end.  
When we grasp the Tao of the ancient ones,   
we can use it to direct our life today.  
To know the ancient origin of Tao:  
this is the beginning of wisdom.  

</p>
<p id="t3d15">The Sages of old were profound  
and knew the ways of subtlety and discernment.  
Their wisdom is beyond our comprehension.  
Because their knowledge was so far superior  
I can only give a poor description.  

They were careful  
as someone crossing a frozen stream in winter.  
Alert as if surrounded on all sides by the enemy.  
Courteous as a guest.  
Fluid as melting ice.  
Whole as an uncarved block of wood.  
Receptive as a valley.  
Turbid as muddied water.  

Who can be still  
until their mud settles  
and the water is cleared by itself?  
Can you remain tranquil until right action occurs by itself?  

The Master doesn't seek fulfillment.  
For only those who are not full are able to be used  
which brings the feeling of completeness.  

</p>
<p id="t3d16">If you can empty your mind of all thoughts  
your heart will embrace the tranquility of peace.  
Watch the workings of all of creation,  
but contemplate their return to the source.  

All creatures in the universe  
return to the point where they began.  
Returning to the source is tranquility  
because we submit to Heaven's mandate.  

Returning to Heaven's mandate is called being constant.  
Knowing the constant is called 'enlightenment'.  
Not knowing the constant is the source of evil deeds  
because we have no roots.  
By knowing the constant we can accept things as they are.  
By accepting things as they are, we become impartial.  
By being impartial, we become one with Heaven.  
By being one with Heaven, we become one with Tao.  
Being one with Tao, we are no longer concerned about  
losing our life because we know the Tao is constant  
and we are one with Tao.  

</p>
<p id="t3d17">The best leaders are those the people hardly know exist.  
The next best is a leader who is loved and praised.  
Next comes the one who is feared.  
The worst one is the leader that is despised.  

If you don't trust the people,  
they will become untrustworthy.  

The best leaders value their words, and use them sparingly.  
When she has accomplished her task,  
the people say, "Amazing:  
we did it, all by ourselves!"  

</p>
<p id="t3d18">When the great Tao is abandoned,  
charity and righteousness appear.  
When intellectualism arises,  
hypocrisy is close behind.  

When there is strife in the family unit,  
people talk about 'brotherly love'.  

When the country falls into chaos,  
politicians talk about 'patriotism'.  

</p>
<p id="t3d19">Forget about knowledge and wisdom,  
and people will be a hundred times better off.  
Throw away charity and righteousness,  
and people will return to brotherly love.  
Throw away profit and greed,  
and there won't be any thieves.  

These three are superficial and aren't enough   
to keep us at the center of the circle, so we must also:  

Embrace simplicity.  
Put others first.  
Desire little.  

</p>
<p id="t3d20">Renounce knowledge and your problems will end.  
What is the difference between yes and no?  
What is the difference between good and evil?  
Must you fear what others fear?  
Nonsense, look how far you have missed the mark!  

Other people are joyous,  
as though they were at a spring festival.  
I alone am unconcerned and expressionless,  
like an infant before it has learned to smile.  

Other people have more than they need;  
I alone seem to possess nothing.  
I am lost and drift about with no place to go.  
I am like a fool, my mind is in chaos.  

Ordinary people are bright;  
I alone am dark.  
Ordinary people are clever;  
I alone am dull.  
Ordinary people seem discriminating;  
I alone am muddled and confused.  
I drift on the waves on the ocean,  
blown at the mercy of the wind.  
Other people have their goals,  
I alone am dull and uncouth.  

I am different from ordinary people.  
I nurse from the Great Mother's breasts.  

</p>
<p id="t3d21">The greatest virtue you can have  
comes from following only the Tao;  
which takes a form that is intangible and evasive.  

Even though the Tao is intangible and evasive,  
we are able to know it exists.  
Intangible and evasive, yet it has a manifestation.  
Secluded and dark, yet there is a vitality within it.  
Its vitality is very genuine.  
Within it we can find order.  

Since the beginning of time, the Tao has always existed.  
It is beyond  existing and not existing.  
How do I know where creation comes from?  
I look inside myself and see it.  

</p>
<p id="t3d22">If you want to become whole,  
first let yourself become broken.  
If you want to become straight,  
first let yourself become twisted.  
If you want to become full,  
first let yourself become empty.  
If you want to become new,  
first let yourself become old.  
Those whose desires are few get them,  
those whose desires are great go astray.  

For this reason the Master embraces the Tao,  
as an example for the world to follow.  
Because she isn't self centered,  
people can see the light in her.  
Because she does not boast of herself,  
she becomes a shining example.  
Because she does not glorify herself,  
she becomes a person of merit.  
Because she wants nothing from the world,  
the world can not overcome her.  

When the ancient Masters said,  
"If you want to become whole,  
then first let yourself be broken,"  
they weren't using empty words.  
All who do this will be made complete.  

</p>
<p id="t3d23">Nature uses few words:  
when the gale blows, it will not last long;  
when it rains hard, it lasts but a little while;  
What causes these to happen?  Heaven and Earth.  

Why do we humans go on endlessly about little  
when nature does much in a little time?  
If you open yourself to the Tao,  
you and Tao become one.  
If you open yourself to Virtue,  
then you can become virtuous.  
If you open yourself to loss,  
then you will become lost.  

If you open yourself to the Tao,  
the Tao will eagerly welcome you.  
If you open yourself to virtue,  
virtue will become a part of you.  
If you open yourself to loss,  
the lost are glad to see you.  

"When you do not trust people,  
people will become untrustworthy."  

</p>
<p id="t3d24">Those who stand on tiptoes  
do not stand firmly.  
Those who rush ahead  
don't get very far.  
Those who try to outshine others  
dim their own light.  
Those who call themselves righteous  
can't know how wrong they are.  
Those who boast of their accomplishments  
diminish the things they have done.  

Compared to the Tao, these actions are unworthy.  
If we are to follow the Tao,   
we must not do these things.  

</p>
<p id="t3d25">Before the universe was born  
there was something in the chaos of the heavens.  
It stands alone and empty,  
solitary and unchanging.  
It is ever present and secure.  
It may be regarded as the Mother of the universe.  
Because I do not know its name,  
I call it the Tao.  
If forced to give it a name,  
I would call it 'Great'.  

Because it is Great means it is everywhere.  
Being everywhere means it is eternal.  
Being eternal means everything returns to it.  

Tao is great.  
Heaven is great.  
Earth is great.  
Humanity is great.  
Within the universe, these are the four great things.  

Humanity follows the earth.  
Earth follows Heaven.  
Heaven follows the Tao.  
The Tao follows only itself.  

</p>
<p id="t3d26">Heaviness is the basis of lightness.  
Stillness is the standard of activity.  

Thus the Master travels all day  
without ever leaving her wagon.  
Even though she has much to see, 
she is at peace in her indifference.  

Why should the lord of a thousand chariots  
be amused at the foolishness of the world?  
If you abandon yourself to foolishness,  
you lose touch with your beginnings.  
If you let yourself become distracted,  
you will lose the basis of your power.  

</p>
<p id="t3d27">A good traveler leaves no tracks,  
and a skillful speaker is well rehearsed.  
A good bookkeeper has an excellent memory,  
and a well made door is easy to open and needs no locks.  
A good knot needs no rope and it can not come undone.  

Thus the Master is willing to help everyone,  
and doesn't know the meaning of rejection.  
She is there to help all of creation,  
and doesn't abandon even the smallest creature.  
This is called embracing the light.  

What is a good person but a bad person's teacher?  
What is a bad person but raw material for his teacher?  
If you fail to honor your teacher or fail to enjoy your student,  
you will become deluded no matter how smart you are.  
It is the secret of prime importance.  

</p>
<p id="t3d28">Know the masculine,  
but keep to the feminine:  
and become a watershed to the world.  
If you embrace the world,  
the Tao will never leave you  
and you become as a little child.  

Know the white,  
yet keep to the black:  
be a model for the world.  
If you are a model for the world,  
the Tao inside you will strengthen  
and you will return whole to your eternal beginning.  

Know the honorable,  
but do not shun the disgraced:  
embracing the world as it is.  
If you embrace the world with compassion,  
then your virtue will return you to the uncarved block.  

The block of wood is carved into utensils  
by carving void into the wood.  
The Master uses the utensils, yet prefers to keep to the block  
because of its limitless possibilities.  
Great works do not involve discarding substance.  

</p>
<p id="t3d29">Do you want to rule the world and control it?  
I don't think it can ever be done.  

The world is a sacred vessel   
and it can not be controlled.  
You will only make it worse if you try.  
It may slip through your fingers and disappear.  

Some are meant to lead,  
and others are meant to follow;  
Some must always strain,  
and others have an easy time;  
Some are naturally big and strong,  
and others will always be small;  
Some will be protected and nurtured,  
and others will meet with destruction.  

The Master accepts things as they are,  
and out of compassion avoids extravagance,  
excess and the extremes.  

</p>
<p id="t3d30">Those who lead people by following the Tao  
don't use weapons to enforce their will.  
Using force always leads to unseen troubles.  

In the places where armies march,  
thorns and briars bloom and grow.  
After armies take to war,  
bad years must always follow.  
The skillful commander   
strikes a decisive blow then stops.  
When victory is won over the enemy through war  
it is not a thing of great pride.  
When the battle is over,  
arrogance is the new enemy.  
War can result when no other alternative is given,  
so the one who overcomes an enemy should not dominate them.  
The strong always weaken with time.  

This is not the way of the Tao.  
That which is not of the Tao will soon end.  

</p>
<p id="t3d31">Weapons are the bearers of bad news;  
all people should detest them.  

The wise man values the left side,  
and in time of war he values the right.  
Weapons are meant for destruction,  
and thus are avoided by the wise.  
Only as a last resort  
will a wise person use a deadly weapon.  
If peace is her true objective  
how can she rejoice in the victory of war?  
Those who rejoice in victory  
delight in the slaughter of humanity.  
Those who resort to violence  
will never bring peace to the world.  
The left side is a place of honor on happy occasions.  
The right side is reserved for mourning at a funeral.  
When the lieutenants take the left side to prepare for war,  
the general should be on the right side,  
because he knows the outcome will be death.  
The death of many should be greeted with great sorrow,  
and the victory celebration should honor those who have died.  

</p>
<p id="t3d32">The Tao is nameless and unchanging.  
Although it appears insignificant,  
nothing in the world can contain it.  

If a ruler abides by its principles,  
then her people will willingly follow.  
Heaven would then reign on earth,  
like sweet rain falling on paradise.  
People would have no need for laws,  
because the law would be written on their hearts.  

Naming is a necessity for order,  
but naming can not order all things.  
Naming often makes things impersonal,  
so we should know when naming should end.  
Knowing when to stop naming,  
you can avoid the pitfall it brings.  

All things end in the Tao  
just as the small streams and the largest rivers  
flow through valleys to the sea.  

</p>
<p id="t3d33">Those who know others are intelligent;  
those who know themselves are truly wise.  
Those who master others are strong;  
those who master themselves have true power.  

Those who know they have enough are truly wealthy.  

Those who persist will reach their goal.  

Those who keep their course have a strong will.  
Those who embrace death will not perish,  
but have life everlasting.  

</p>
<p id="t3d34">The great Tao flows unobstructed in every direction.  
All things rely on it to conceive and be born,  
and it does not deny even the smallest of creation.  
When it has accomplished great wonders,  
it does not claim them for itself.  
It nourishes infinite worlds,  
yet it doesn't seek to master the smallest creature.  
Since it is without wants and desires,  
it can be considered humble.  
All of creation seeks it for refuge  
yet it does not seek to master or control.  
Because it does not seek greatness;  
it is able to accomplish truly great things.  

</p>
<p id="t3d35">She who follows the way of the Tao  
will draw the world to her steps.  
She can go without fear of being injured,  
because she has found peace and tranquility in her heart.  

Where there is music and good food,  
people will stop to enjoy it.  
But words spoken of the Tao   
seem to them boring and stale.  
When looked at, there is nothing for them to see.  
When listened for, there is nothing for them to hear.  
Yet if they put it to use, it would never be exhausted.  

</p>
<p id="t3d36">If you want something to return to the source,  
you must first allow it to spread out.  
If you want something to weaken,  
you must first allow it to become strong.  
If you want something to be removed,  
you must first allow it to flourish.  
If you want to possess something,  
you must first give it away.  

This is called the subtle understanding  
of how things are meant to be.  

The soft and pliable overcomes the hard and inflexible.  

Just as fish remain hidden in deep waters,  
it is best to keep weapons out of sight.  

</p>
<p id="t3d37">The Tao never acts with force,  
yet there is nothing that it can not do.  

If rulers could follow the way of the Tao,  
then all of creation would willingly follow their example.  
If selfish desires were to arise after their transformation,  
I would erase them with the power of the Uncarved Block.  

By the power of the Uncarved Block,  
future generations would lose their selfish desires.  
By losing their selfish desires,  
the world would naturally settle into peace.  

</p>
<p id="t3d38">The highest good is not to seek to do good,  
but to allow yourself to become it.  
The ordinary person seeks to do good things,  
and finds that they can not do them continually.  

The Master does not force virtue on others,  
thus she is able to accomplish her task.  
The ordinary person who uses force,  
will find that they accomplish nothing.  

The kind person acts from the heart,  
and accomplishes a multitude of things.  
The righteous person acts out of pity,  
yet leaves many things undone.  
The moral person will act out of duty,  
and when no one will respond  
will roll up his sleeves and use force.  

When the Tao is forgotten, there is righteousness.  
When righteousness is forgotten, there is morality.  
When morality is forgotten, there is the law.  
The law is the husk of faith,  
and trust is the beginning of chaos.  

Our basic understandings are not from the Tao  
because they come from the depths of our misunderstanding.  
The master abides in the fruit and not in the husk.  
She dwells in the Tao,  
and not with the things that hide it.  
This is how she increases in wisdom.  

</p>
<p id="t3d39">The masters of old attained unity with the Tao.  
Heaven attained unity and became pure.  
The earth attained unity and found peace.  
The spirits attained unity so they could minister.  
The valleys attained unity that they might be full.  
Humanity attained unity that they might flourish.  
Their leaders attained unity that they might set the example.  
This is the power of unity.  

Without unity, the sky becomes filthy.  
Without unity, the earth becomes unstable.  
Without unity, the spirits become unresponsive and disappear.  
Without unity, the valleys become dry as a desert.  
Without unity, human kind can't reproduce and becomes extinct.  
Without unity, our leaders become corrupt and fall.  

The great view the small as their source,  
and the high takes the low as their foundation.  
Their greatest asset becomes their humility.  
They speak of themselves as orphans and widows,  
thus they truly seek humility.  
Do not shine like the precious gem,  
but be as dull as a common stone.  

</p>
<p id="t3d40">All movement returns to the Tao.  
Weakness is how the Tao works.  

All of creation is born from substance.  
Substance is born of nothing-ness.  

</p>
<p id="t3d41">When a superior person hears of the Tao,  
She diligently puts it into practice.  
When an average person hears of the Tao,  
he believes half of it, and doubts the other half.  
When a foolish person hears of the Tao,  
he laughs out loud at the very idea.  
If he didn't laugh,  
it wouldn't be the Tao.  

Thus it is said:  
The brightness of the Tao seems like darkness,  
the advancement of the Tao seems like retreat,  
the level path seems rough,  
the superior path seem empty,  
the pure seems to be tarnished,  
and true virtue doesn't seem to be enough.  
The virtue of caution seems like cowardice,  
the pure seems to be polluted,  
the true square seems to have no corners,  
the best vessels take the most time to finish,  
the greatest sounds cannot be heard,  
and the greatest image has no form.  

The Tao hides in the unnamed,  
Yet it alone nourishes and completes all things.  

</p>
<p id="t3d42">The Tao gave birth to One.  
The One gave birth to Two.  
The Two gave birth to Three.  
The Three gave birth to all of creation.  

All things carry Yin  
yet embrace Yang.  
They blend their life breaths  
in order to produce harmony.  

People despise being orphaned, widowed and poor.  
But the noble ones take these as their titles.  
In losing, much is gained,  
and in gaining, much is lost.  

What others teach I too will teach:   
"The strong and violent will not die a natural death."  

</p>
<p id="t3d43">That which offers no resistance,  
overcomes the hardest substances.  
That which offers no resistance  
can enter where there is no space.  

Few in the world can comprehend  
the teaching without words,  
or understand the value of non-action.  

</p>
<p id="t3d44">Which is more important, your honor or your life?  
Which is more valuable, your possessions or your person?  
Which is more destructive, success or failure?  

Because of this, great love extracts a great cost  
and true wealth requires greater loss.  

Knowing when you have enough avoids dishonor,  
and knowing when to stop will keep you from danger  
and bring you a long, happy life.  

</p>
<p id="t3d45">The greatest accomplishments seem imperfect,  
yet their usefulness is not diminished.  
The greatest fullness seems empty,  
yet it will be inexhaustible.  

The greatest straightness seems crooked.  
The most valued skill seems like clumsiness.  
The greatest speech seems full of stammers.  

Movement overcomes the cold,  
and stillness overcomes the heat.  
That which is pure and still is the universal ideal.  

</p>
<p id="t3d46">When the world follows the Tao,  
horses run free to fertilize the fields.  
When the world does not follow the Tao,  
war horses are bred outside the cities.  

There is no greater transgression  
than condoning people's selfish desires,  
no greater disaster than being discontent,  
and no greater retribution than for greed.  

Whoever knows contentment will be at peace forever.  

</p>
<p id="t3d47">Without opening your door,  
you can know the whole world.  
Without looking out your window,  
you can understand the way of the Tao.  

The more knowledge you seek,  
the less you will understand.  

The Master understands without leaving,  
sees clearly without looking,  
accomplishes much without doing anything.  

</p>
<p id="t3d48">One who seeks knowledge learns something new every day.  
One who seeks the Tao unlearns something new every day.  
Less and less remains until you arrive at non-action.  
When you arrive at non-action,  
nothing will be left undone.  

Mastery of the world is achieved  
by letting things take their natural course.  
You can not master the world by changing the natural way.  

</p>
<p id="t3d49">The Master has no mind of her own.  
She understands the mind of the people.  

Those who are good she treats as good.  
Those who aren't good she also treats as good.  
This is how she attains true goodness.  

She trusts people who are trustworthy.  
She also trusts people who aren't trustworthy.  
This is how she gains true trust.  

The Master's mind is shut off from the world.  
Only for the sake of the people does she muddle her mind.  
They look to her in anticipation.  
Yet she treats them all as her children.  

</p>
<p id="t3d50">Those who leave the womb at birth  
and those who enter their source at death,  
of these; three out of ten celebrate life,  
three out of ten celebrate death,  
and three out of ten simply go from life to death.  
What is the reason for this?  
Because they are afraid of dying,  
therefore they can not live.  

I have heard that those who celebrate life  
walk safely among the wild animals.  
When they go into battle, they remain unharmed.  
The animals find no place to attack them  
and the weapons are unable to harm them.  
Why?  Because they can find no place for death in them. 

</p>
<p id="t3d51">The Tao gives birth to all of creation.  
The virtue of Tao in nature nurtures them,  
and their families give them their form.  
Their environment then shapes them into completion.  
That is why every creature honors the Tao and its virtue.  

No one tells them to honor the Tao and its virtue,  
it happens all by itself.  
So the Tao gives them birth,  
and its virtue cultivates them,  
cares for them,  
nurtures them,  
gives them a place of refuge and peace,  
helps them to grow and shelters them.  

It gives them life without wanting to posses them,  
and cares for them expecting nothing in return.  
It is their master, but it does not seek to dominate them.  
This is called the dark and mysterious virtue.  

</p>
<p id="t3d52">The world had a beginning  
which we call the Great Mother.  
Once we have found the Mother,  
we begin to know what Her children should be.  

When we know we are the Mother's child,  
we begin to guard the qualities of the Mother in us.  
She will protect us from all danger  
even if we lose our life.  

Keep your mouth closed  
and embrace a simple life,  
and you will live care-free until the end of your days.  
If you try to talk your way into a better life  
there will be no end to your trouble.  

To understand the small is called clarity.  
Knowing how to yield is called strength.  
To use your inner light for understanding 
regardless of the danger  
is called depending on the Constant.  

</p>
<p id="t3d53">If I understood only one thing,  
I would want to use it to follow the Tao.  
My only fear would be one of pride.  
The Tao goes in the level places,  
but people prefer to take the short cuts.  

If too much time is spent cleaning the house  
the land will become neglected and full of weeds,  
and the granaries will soon become empty  
because there is no one out working the fields.  
To wear fancy clothes and ornaments,  
to have your fill of food and drink  
and to waste all of your money buying possessions  
is called the crime of excess.  
Oh, how these things go against the way of the Tao!  

</p>
<p id="t3d54">That which is well built  
will never be torn down.  
That which is well latched  
can not slip away.  
Those who do things well  
will be honored from generation to generation.  

If this idea is cultivated in the individual,  
then his virtue will become genuine.  
If this idea is cultivated in your family,  
then virtue in your family will be great.  
If this idea is cultivated in your community,  
then virtue will go a long way.  
If this idea is cultivated in your country,  
then virtue will be in many places.  
If this idea is cultivated in the world,  
then virtue will be with everyone.  

Then observe the person for what the person does,  
and observe the family for what it does,  
and observe the community for what it does,  
and observe the country for what it does,  
and observe the world for what it does.  
How do I know this saying is true?  
I observe these things and see.  

</p>
<p id="t3d55">One who is filled with the Tao  
is like a newborn child.  
The infant is protected from  
the stinging insects, wild beasts, and birds of prey.  
Its bones are soft, its muscles are weak,  
but its grip is firm and strong.  
It doesn't know about the union  
of male and female,  
yet his penis can stand erect,  
because of the power of life within him.  
It can cry all day and never become hoarse.  
This is perfect harmony.  

To understand harmony is to understand the Constant.  
To know the Constant is to be called 'enlightened'.  
To unnaturally try to extend life is not appropriate.  
To try and alter the life-breath is unnatural.  
The master understands that when something reaches its prime  
it will soon begin to decline.  
Changing the natural is against the way of the Tao.  
Those who do it will come to an early end.  

</p>
<p id="t3d56">Those who know do not talk.  
Those who talk do not know.  

Stop talking,  
meditate in silence,  
blunt your sharpness,  
release your worries,  
harmonize your inner light,  
and become one with the dust.  
Doing this is the called the dark and mysterious identity.  

Those who have achieved the mysterious identity  
can not be approached, and they can not be alienated.  
They can not be benefited nor harmed.  
They can not be made noble nor to suffer disgrace.  
This makes them the most noble of all under the heavens.  

</p>
<p id="t3d57">Govern your country with integrity,  
Weapons of war can be used with great cunning,  
but loyalty is only won by not-doing.  
How do I know the way things are?  
By these:  

The more prohibitions you make,  
the poorer people will be.  
The more weapons you possess,  
the greater the chaos in your country.  
The more knowledge that is acquired,  
the stranger the world will become.  
The more laws that you make,  
the greater the number of criminals.  

Therefore the Master says:  
I do nothing,  
and people become good by themselves.  
I seek peace,  
and people take care of their own problems.  
I do not meddle in their personal lives,  
and the people become prosperous.  
I let go of all my desires,  
and the people return to the Uncarved Block.  

</p>
<p id="t3d58">If a government is unobtrusive,  
the people become whole.  
If a government is repressive,  
the people become treacherous.  

Good fortune has its roots in disaster,  
and disaster lurks with good fortune.  
Who knows why these things happen,  
or when this cycle will end?  
Good things seem to change into bad,  
and bad things often turn out for good.  
These things have always been hard to comprehend.  

Thus the Master makes things change  
without interfering.  
She is probing yet causes no harm.  
Straightforward, yet does not impose her will.  
Radiant, and easy on the eye.  

</p>
<p id="t3d59">There is nothing better than moderation  
for teaching people or serving Heaven.  
Those who use moderation  
are already on the path to the Tao.  

Those who follow the Tao early  
will have an abundance of virtue.  
When there is an abundance of virtue,  
there is nothing that can not be done.  
Where there is limitless ability,  
then the kingdom is withing your grasp.  
When you know the Mother of the kingdom,  
then you will be long enduring.  

This is spoken of as the deep root and the firm trunk,  
the Way to a long life and great spiritual vision.  

</p>
<p id="t3d60">Governing a large country  
is like frying small fish.  
Too much poking spoils the meat.  

When the Tao is used to govern the world  
then evil will lose its power to harm the people.  
Not that evil will no longer exist,  
but only because it has lost its power.  
Just as evil can lose its ability to harm,  
the Master shuns the use of violence.  

If you give evil nothing to oppose,  
then virtue will return by itself.  

</p>
<p id="t3d61">A large country should take the low place like a great watershed,  
which from its low position assumes the female role.  
The female overcomes the male by the power of her position.  
Her tranquility gives rise to her humility.  

If a large country takes the low position,  
it will be able to influence smaller countries.  
If smaller countries take the lower position,  
then they can allow themselves to be influenced.  
So both seek to take the lower position  
in order to influence the other, or be influenced.  

Large countries should desire to protect and help the people,  
and small countries should desire to serve others.  
Both large and small countries benefit greatly from humility.  

</p>
<p id="t3d62">The Tao is the tabernacle of creation,  
it is a treasure for those who are good,  
and a place of refuge for those who are not.  

How can those who are not good be abandoned?  
Words that are beautiful are worth much,  
but good behavior can only be learned by example.  

When a new leader takes office,  
don't give him gifts and offerings.  
These things are not as valuable  
as teaching him about the Tao.  

Why was the Tao esteemed by the ancient Masters?  
Is it not said: "With it we find without looking.  
With it we find forgiveness for our transgressions."  
That is why the world can not understand it.  

</p>
<p id="t3d63">Act by not acting;  
do by not doing.  
Enjoy the plain and simple.  
Find that greatness in the small.  
Take care of difficult problems  
while they are still easy;  
Do easy things before they become too hard.  

Difficult problems are best solved while they are easy.  
Great projects are best started while they are small.  
The Master never takes on more than she can handle,  
which means that she leaves nothing undone.  

When an affirmation is given too lightly,  
keep your eyes open for trouble ahead.  
When something seems too easy,  
difficulty is hiding in the details.  
The master expects great difficulty,  
so the task is always easier than planned.  

</p>
<p id="t3d64">Things are easier to control while things are quiet.  
Things are easier to plan far in advance.  
Things break easier while they are still brittle.  
Things are easier hid while they are still small.  

Prevent problems before they arise.  
Take action before things get out of hand.  
The tallest tree  
begins as a tiny sprout.  
The tallest building  
starts with one shovel of dirt.  
A journey of a thousand miles  
starts with a single footstep.  

If you rush into action, you will fail.  
If you hold on too tight, you will lose your grip.  

Therefore the Master lets things take their course  
and thus never fails.  
She doesn't hold on to things  
and never loses them.  
By pursing your goals too relentlessly,  
you let them slip away.  
If you are as concerned about the outcome  
as you are about the beginning,  
then it is hard to do things wrong.  
The master seeks no possessions.  
She learns by unlearning,  
thus she is able to understand all things.  
This gives her the ability to help all of creation.  

</p>
<p id="t3d65">The ancient Masters  
who understood the way of the Tao,  
did not educate people, but made them forget.  

Smart people are difficult to guide,  
because they think they are too clever.  
To use cleverness to rule a country,  
is to lead the country to ruin.  
To avoid cleverness in ruling a country,  
is to lead the country to prosperity.  

Knowing the two alternatives is a pattern.  
Remaining aware of the pattern is a virtue.  
This dark and mysterious virtue is profound.  
It is opposite our natural inclination,  
but leads to harmony with the heavens.  

</p>
<p id="t3d66">Rivers and seas are rulers   
of the streams of hundreds of valleys  
because of the power of their low position.  

If you want to be the ruler of people,  
you must speak to them like you are their servant.  
If you want to lead other people,  
you must put their interest ahead of your own.  

The people will not feel burdened,  
if a wise person is in a position of power.  
The people will not feel like they are being manipulated,  
if a wise person is in front as their leader.  
The whole world will ask for her guidance,  
and will never get tired of her.  
Because she does not like to compete,  
no one can compete with the things she accomplishes.  

</p>
<p id="t3d67">The world talks about honoring the Tao,  
but you can't tell it from their actions.  
Because it is thought of as great,  
the world makes light of it.  
It seems too easy for anyone to use.  

There are three jewels that I cherish:  
compassion, moderation, and humility.  
With compassion, you will be able to be brave,  
With moderation, you will be able to give to others,  
With humility, you will be able to become a great leader.  
To abandon compassion while seeking to be brave,  
or abandoning moderation while being benevolent,  
or abandoning humility while seeking to lead  
will only lead to greater trouble.  
The compassionate warrior will be the winner,  
and if compassion is your defense you will be secure.  
Compassion is the protector of Heaven's salvation.  

</p>
<p id="t3d68">The best warriors  
do not use violence.  
The best generals  
do not destroy indiscriminately.  
The best tacticians  
try to avoid confrontation.  
The best leaders  
become servants of their people.  

This is called the virtue of non-competition.  
This is called the power to manage others.  
This is called attaining harmony with the heavens.  

</p>
<p id="t3d69">There is an old saying:  
"It is better to become the passive  
in order to see what will happen.  
It is better to retreat a foot  
than to advance only an inch."  

This is called  
being flexible while advancing,  
pushing back without using force,  
and destroying the enemy without engaging him.  

There is no greater disaster  
than underestimating your enemy.  
Underestimating your enemy  
means loosing your greatest assets.  
When equal forces meet in battle,  
victory will go to the one  
that enters with the greatest sorrow.  

</p>
<p id="t3d70">My words are easy to understand  
and easier to put into practice.  
Yet no one in the world seems to understand them,  
or be able to apply what I teach.  

My teachings come from the ancients,  
the things I do are done for a reason.  

Because you do not know me,  
you are not able to understand my teachings.  
Because those who know me are few,  
my teachings become even more precious.  

</p>
<p id="t3d71">Knowing you don't know is wholeness.  
Thinking you know is a disease.  
Only by recognizing that you have an illness  
can you move to seek a cure.  

The Master is whole because   
she sees her illnesses and treats them,  
and thus is able to remain whole.  

</p>
<p id="t3d72">When people become overly bold,  
then disaster will soon arrive.  

Do not meddle with people's livelihoods;  
if you respect them, they will in turn respect you.  

Therefore, the Master knows herself but is not arrogant.  
She loves herself but also loves others.  
This is how she is able to make appropriate choices.  

</p>
<p id="t3d73">Being over bold and confident is deadly.  
The wise use of caution will keep you alive.  

One is the way to death,  
and the other is the way to preserve your life.  
Who can understand the workings of Heaven?  

The Tao of the universe  
does not compete, yet wins;  
does not speak, yet responds;  
does not command, yet is obeyed;  
and does act, but is good at directing.  

The nets of Heaven are wide,  
but nothing escapes its grasp.  

</p>
<p id="t3d74">If you do not fear death,  
then how can it intimidate you?  
If you aren't afraid of dying,  
there is nothing you can not do.  

Those who harm others  
are like inexperienced boys  
trying to take the place of a great lumberjack.  
Trying to fill his shoes will only get them seriously hurt.  

</p>
<p id="t3d75">When people go hungry,  
the government's taxes are too high.  
When people become rebellious,  
the government has become too intrusive.  

When people begin to view death lightly,  
wealthy people have too much  
which causes others to starve.  

Only those who do not cling to their life can save it.   

</p>
<p id="t3d76">The living are soft and yielding;  
the dead are rigid and stiff.  
Living plants are flexible and tender;  
the dead are brittle and dry.  

Those who are stiff and rigid  
are the disciple of death.  
Those who are soft and yielding  
are the disciples of life.  

The rigid and stiff will be broken.  
The soft and yielding will overcome.  

</p>
<p id="t3d77">The Tao of Heaven works in the world 
like the drawing of a bow.  
The top is bent downward;  
the bottom is bent up.  
The excess is taken from,  
and the deficient is given to.  

The Tao works to use the excess,  
and gives to that which is depleted.  
The way of people is to take from the depleted,  
and give to those who already have an excess.   

Who is able to give to the needy from their excess?  
Only someone who is following the way of the Tao.  

This is why the Master gives  
expecting nothing in return.  
She does not dwell on her past accomplishments,  
and does not glory in any praise.  

</p>
<p id="t3d78">Water is the softest and most yielding substance.  
Yet nothing is better than water,  
for overcoming the hard and rigid,  
because nothing can compete with it.  

Everyone knows that the soft and yielding  
overcomes the rigid and hard,  
but few can put this knowledge into practice.  

Therefore the Master says:  
"Only he who is the lowest servant of the kingdom,  
is worthy to become its ruler.  
He who is willing to tackle the most unpleasant tasks,  
is the best ruler in the world."  

True sayings seem contradictory.  

</p>
<p id="t3d79">Difficulties remain, even after solving a problem.  
How then can we consider that as good?  

Therefore the Master  
does what she knows is right,  
and makes no demands of others.  
A virtuous person will do the right thing,  
and persons with no virtue will take advantage of others.  

The Tao does not choose sides,  
the good person receives from the Tao  
because she is on its side.  

</p>
<p id="t3d80">Small countries with few people are best.  
Give them all of the things they want,  
and they will see that they do not need them.  
Teach them that death is a serious thing,  
and to be content to never leave their homes.  
Even though they have plenty  
of horses, wagons and boats,  
they won't feel that they need to use them.  
Even if they have weapons and shields,  
they will keep them out of sight.  
Let people enjoy the simple technologies,  
let them enjoy their food,  
let them make their own clothes,  
let them be content with their own homes,   
and delight in the customs that they cherish.  
Although the next country is close enough  
that they can hear their roosters crowing and dogs barking,  
they are content never to visit each other  
all of the days of their lives.  

</p>
<p id="t3d81">True words do not sound beautiful;  
beautiful sounding words are not true.  
Wise men don't need to debate;  
men who need to debate are not wise.  

Wise men are not scholars,  
and scholars are not wise.  
The Master desires no possessions.  
Since the things she does are for the people,  
she has more than she needs.  
The more she gives to others,  
the more she has for herself.  

The Tao of Heaven nourishes by not forcing.  
The Tao of the Wise person acts by not competing.  

</p>
<p id="t4d01">The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and Earth.
The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.
Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.
Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations.
These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness.
Darkness within darkness.
The gate to all mystery.


</p>
<p id="t4d02">Under heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness.
All can know good as good only because there is evil.

Therefore having and not having arise together.
Difficult and easy complement each other.
Long and short contrast each other:
High and low rest upon each other;
Voice and sound harmonize each other;
Front and back follow one another.

Therefore the sage goes about doing nothing, teaching no-talking.
The ten thousand things rise and fall without cease,
Creating, yet not.
Working, yet not taking credit.
Work is done, then forgotten.
Therefore it lasts forever.

</p>
<p id="t4d03">Not exalting the gifted prevents quarreling.
Not collecting treasures prevents stealing.
Not seeing desirable things prevents confusion of the heart.

The wise therefore rule by emptying hearts and stuffing bellies, by weakening ambitions and strengthening bones.
If men lack knowledge and desire, then clever people will not try to interfere.
If nothing is done, then all will be well.


</p>
<p id="t4d04">The Tao is an empty vessel; it is used, but never filled.
Oh, unfathomable source of ten thousand things!
Blunt the sharpness,
Untangle the knot,
Soften the glare,
Merge with dust.
Oh, hidden deep but ever present!
I do not know from whence it comes.
It is the forefather of the gods.


</p>
<p id="t4d05">Heaven and Earth are impartial;
They see the ten thousand things as straw dogs.
The wise are impartial;
They see the people as straw dogs.

The space between heaven and Earth is like a bellows.
The shape changes but not the form;
The more it moves, the more it yields.
More words count less.
Hold fast to the center.


</p>
<p id="t4d06">The valley spirit never dies;
It is the woman, primal mother.
Her gateway is the root of heaven and Earth.
It is like a veil barely seen.
Use it; it will never fail.


</p>
<p id="t4d07">Heaven and Earth last forever.
Why do heaven and Earth last forever?
They are unborn,
So ever living.
The sage stays behind, thus he is ahead.
He is detached, thus at one with all.
Through selfless action, he attains fulfillment.


</p>
<p id="t4d08">The highest good is like water.
Water give life to the ten thousand things and does not strive.
It flows in places men reject and so is like the Tao.

In dwelling, be close to the land.
In meditation, go deep in the heart.
In dealing with others, be gentle and kind.
In speech, be true.
In ruling, be just.
In daily life, be competent.
In action, be aware of the time and the season.

No fight:  No blame.


</p>
<p id="t4d09">Better to stop short than fill to the brim.
Over-sharpen the blade, and the edge will soon blunt.
Amass a store of gold and jade, and no one can protect it.
Claim wealth and titles, and disaster will follow.
Retire when the work is done.
This is the way of heaven.


</p>
<p id="t4d10">Carrying body and soul and embracing the one,
Can you avoid separation?
Attending fully and becoming supple,
Can you be as a newborn babe?
Washing and cleansing the primal vision,
Can you be without stain?
Loving all men and ruling the country,
Can you be without cleverness?
Opening and closing the gates of heaven,
Can you play the role of woman?
Understanding and being open to all things,
Are you able to do nothing?
Giving birth and nourishing,
Bearing yet not possessing,
Working yet not taking credit,
Leading yet not dominating,
This is the Primal Virtue.


</p>
<p id="t4d11">Thirty spokes share the wheel's hub;
It is the center hole that makes it useful.
Shape clay into a vessel;
It is the space within that makes it useful.
Cut doors and windows for a room;
It is the holes which make it useful.
Therefore benefit comes from what is there;
Usefulness from what is not there.


</p>
<p id="t4d12">The five colors blind the eye.
The five tones deafen the ear.
The five flavors dull the taste.
Racing and hunting madden the mind.
Precious things lead one astray.

Therefore the sage is guided by what he feels and not by what he sees.
He lets go of that and chooses this.


</p>
<p id="t4d13">Accept disgrace willingly.
Accept misfortune as the human condition.

What do you mean by "Accept disgrace willingly"?
Accept being unimportant.
Do not be concerned with loss or gain.
This is called "accepting disgrace willingly."

What do you mean by "Accept misfortune as the human condition"?
Misfortune comes from having a body.
Without a body, how could there be misfortune?

Surrender yourself humbly; then you can be trusted to care for all things.
Love the world as your own self; then you can truly care for all things.


</p>
<p id="t4d14">Look, it cannot be seen - it is beyond form.
Listen, it cannot be heard - it is beyond sound.
Grasp, it cannot be held - it is intangible.
These three are indefinable;
Therefore they are joined in one.

From above it is not bright;
From below it is not dark:
An unbroken thread beyond description.
It returns to nothingness.
The form of the formless,
The image of the imageless,
It is called indefinable and beyond imagination.

Stand before it and there is no beginning.
Follow it and there is no end.
Stay with the ancient Tao,
Move with the present.

Knowing the ancient beginning is the essence of Tao.


</p>
<p id="t4d15">The ancient masters were subtle, mysterious, profound, responsive.
The depth of their knowledge is unfathomable.
Because it is unfathomable,
All we can do is describe their appearance.
Watchful, like men crossing a winter stream.
Alert, like men aware of danger.
Courteous, like visiting guests.
Yielding like ice about to melt.
Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood.
Hollow, like caves.
Opaque, like muddy pools.

Who can wait quietly while the mud settles?
Who can remain still until the moment of action?
Observers of the Tao do not seek fulfillment.
Not seeking fulfillment, they are not swayed by desire for change.


</p>
<p id="t4d16">Empty yourself of everything.
Let the mind become still.
The ten thousand things rise and fall while the Self watches their return.
They grow and flourish and then return to the source.
Returning to the source is stillness, which is the way of nature.
The way of nature is unchanging.
Knowing constancy is insight.
Not knowing constancy leads to disaster.
Knowing constancy, the mind is open.
With an open mind, you will be openhearted.
Being openhearted, you will act royally.
Being royal, you will attain the divine.
Being divine, you will be at one with the Tao.
Being at one with the Tao is eternal.
And though the body dies, the Tao will never pass away.


</p>
<p id="t4d17">The very highest is barely known.
Then comes that which people know and love.
Then that which is feared,
Then that which is despised.

Who does not trust enough will not be trusted.

When actions are performed
Without unnecessary speech,
People say, "We did it!"


</p>
<p id="t4d18">When the great Tao is forgotten,
Kindness and morality arise.
When wisdom and intelligence are born,
The great pretense begins.

When there is no peace within the family,
Filial piety and devotion arise.
When the country is confused and in chaos,
Loyal ministers appear.


</p>
<p id="t4d19">Give up sainthood, renounce wisdom,
And it will be a hundred times better for everyone.

Give up kindness, renounce morality,
And men will rediscover filial piety and love.

Give up ingenuity, renounce profit,
And bandits and thieves will disappear.

These three are outward forms alone; they are not sufficient in themselves.
It is more important
To see the simplicity,
To realize one's true nature,
To cast off selfishness
And temper desire.


</p>
<p id="t4d20">Give up learning, and put an end to your troubles.

Is there a difference between yes and no?
Is there a difference between good and evil?
Must I fear what others fear?  What nonsense!
Other people are contented, enjoying the sacrificial feast of the ox.
In spring some go to the park, and climb the terrace,
But I alone am drifting, not knowing where I am.
Like a newborn babe before it learns to smile,
I am alone, without a place to go.
Others have more than they need, but I alone have nothing.
I am a fool.  Oh, yes!  I am confused.
Others are clear and bright,
But I alone am dim and weak.
Others are sharp and clever,
But I alone am dull and stupid.
Oh, I drift like the waves of the sea,
Without direction, like the restless wind.
Everyone else is busy,
But I alone am aimless and depressed.
I am different.
I am nourished by the great mother.


</p>
<p id="t4d21">The greatest Virtue is to follow Tao and Tao alone.
The Tao is elusive and intangible.
Oh, it is intangible and elusive, and yet within is image.
Oh, it is elusive and intangible, and yet within is form.
Oh, it is dim and dark, and yet within is essence.
This essence is very real, and therein lies faith.
From the very beginning until now its name has never been forgotten.
Thus I perceive the creation.
How do I know the ways of creation?
Because of this.


</p>
<p id="t4d22">Yield and overcome;
Bend and be straight;
Empty and be full;
Wear out and be new;
Have little and gain;
Have much and be confused.

Therefore the wise embrace the one
And set an example to all.
Not putting on a display,
They shine forth.
Not justifying themselves,
They are distinguished.
Not boasting,
They receive recognition.
Not bragging,
They never falter.
They do not quarrel,
So no one quarrels with them.
Therefore the ancients say, "Yield and overcome."
Is that an empty saying?
Be really whole,
And all things will come to you.


</p>
<p id="t4d23">To talk little is natural.
High winds do not last all morning.
Heavy rain does not last all day.
Why is this?  Heaven and Earth!
If heaven and Earth cannot make things eternal,
How is it possible for man?
He who follows the Tao
Is at one with the Tao.
He who is virtuous
Experiences Virtue.
He who loses the way
Is lost.
When you are at one with the Tao,
The Tao welcomes you.
When you are at one with Virtue,
The Virtue is always there.
When you are at one with loss,
The loss is experienced willingly.

He who does not trust enough
Will not be trusted.


</p>
<p id="t4d24">He who stands on tiptoe is not steady.
He who strides cannot maintain the pace.
He who makes a show is not enlightened.
He who is self-righteous is not respected.
He who boasts achieves nothing.
He who brags will not endure.
According to followers of the Tao, "These are extra food and unnecessary luggage."
They do not bring happiness.
therefore followers of the Tao avoid them.


</p>
<p id="t4d25">Something mysteriously formed,
Born before heaven and Earth.
In the silence and the void,
Standing alone and unchanging,
Ever present and in motion.
Perhaps it is the mother of ten thousand things.
I do not know its name
Call it Tao.
For lack of a better word, I call it great.

Being great, it flows
I flows far away.
Having gone far, it returns.

Therefore, "Tao is great;
Heaven is great;
Earth is great;
The king is also great."
These are the four great powers of the universe,
And the king is one of them.

Man follows Earth.
Earth follows heaven.
Heaven follows the Tao.
Tao follows what is natural.


</p>
<p id="t4d26">The heavy is the root of the light.
The still is the master of unrest.

Therefore the sage, traveling all day,
Does not lose sight of his baggage.
Though there are beautiful things to be seen,
He remains unattached and calm.

Why should the lord of ten thousand chariots act lightly in public?
To be light is to lose one's root.
To be restless is to lose one's control.


</p>
<p id="t4d27">A good walker leaves no tracks;
A good speaker makes no slips;
A good reckoner needs no tally.
A good door needs no lock,
Yet no one can open it.
Good binding requires no knots,
Yet no one can loosen it.

Therefore the sage takes care of all men
And abandons no one.
He takes care of all things
And abandons nothing.

This is called "following the light."

What is a good man?
A teacher of a bad man.
What is a bad man?
A good man's charge.
If the teacher is not respected,
And the student not cared for,
Confusion will arise, however clever one is.
This is the crux of mystery.


</p>
<p id="t4d28">Know the strength of man,
But keep a woman's care!
Be the stream of the universe!
Being the stream of the universe,
Ever true and unswerving,
Become as a little child once more.

Know the white,
But keep the black!
Be an example to the world!
Being an example to the world,
Ever true and unwavering,
Return to the infinite.

Know honor,
Yet keep humility.
Be the valley of the universe!
Being the valley of the universe,
Ever true and resourceful,
Return to the state of the uncarved block.

When the block is carved, it becomes useful.
When the sage uses it, he becomes the ruler.
Thus, "A great tailor cuts little."


</p>
<p id="t4d29">Do you think you can take over the universe and improve it?
I do not believe it can be done.

The universe is sacred.
You cannot improve it.
If you try to change it, you will ruin it.
If you try to hold it, you will lose it.

So sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind;
Sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily;
Sometimes there is strength and sometimes weakness;
Sometimes one is up and sometimes down.

Therefore the sage avoids extremes, excesses, and complacency.


</p>
<p id="t4d30">Whenever you advise a ruler in the way of Tao,
Counsel him not to use force to conquer the universe.
For this would only cause resistance.
Thorn bushes spring up wherever the army has passed.
Lean years follow in the wake of a great war.
Just do what needs to be done.
Never take advantage of power.

Achieve results,
But never glory in them.
Achieve results,
But never boast.
Achieve results,
But never be proud.
Achieve results,
Because this is the natural way.
Achieve results,
But not through violence.

Force is followed by loss of strength.
This is not the way of Tao.
That which goes against the Tao comes to an early end.


</p>
<p id="t4d31">Good weapons are instruments of fear; all creatures hate them.
Therefore followers of Tao never use them.
The wise man prefers the left.
The man of war prefers the right.

Weapons are instruments of fear; they are not a wise man's tools.
He uses them only when he has no choice.
Peace and quiet are dear to his heart,
And victory no cause for rejoicing.
If you rejoice in victory, then you delight in killing;
If you delight in killing, you cannot fulfill yourself.

On happy occasions precedence is given to the left,
On sad occasions to the right.
In the army the general stands on the left,
The commander-in-chief on the right.
This means that war is conducted like a funeral.
When many people are being killed,
They should be mourned in heartfelt sorrow.
That is why a victory must be observed like a funeral.


</p>
<p id="t4d32">The Tao is forever undefined.
Small though it is in the unformed state, it cannot be grasped.
If kings and lords could harness it,
The ten thousand things would come together
And gentle rain fall.
Men would need no more instruction and all things would take their course.

Once the whole is divided, the parts need names.
There are already enough names.
One must know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop averts trouble.
Tao in the world is like a river flowing home to the sea.

</p>
<p id="t4d33">Knowing others is wisdom;
Knowing the self is enlightenment.
Mastering others requires force;
Mastering the self needs strength.

He who knows he has enough is rich.
Perseverance is a sign of willpower.
He who stays where he is endures.
To die but not to perish is to be eternally present.


</p>
<p id="t4d34">The great Tao flows everywhere, both to the left and to the right.
The ten thousand things depend upon it; it holds nothing back.
It fulfills its purpose silently and makes no claim.

It nourishes the ten thousand things,
And yet is not their lord.
It has no aim; it is very small.

The ten thousand things return to it,
Yet it is not their lord.
It is very great.

It does not show greatness,
And is therefore truly great.


</p>
<p id="t4d35">All men will come to him who keeps to the one,
For there lie rest and happiness and peace.

Passersby may stop for music and good food,
But a description of the Tao
Seems without substance or flavor.
It cannot be seen, it cannot be heard,
And yet it cannot be exhausted.


</p>
<p id="t4d36">That which shrinks
Must first expand.
That which fails
Must first be strong.
That which is cast down
Must first be raised.
Before receiving
There must be giving.

This is called perception of the nature of things.
Soft and weak overcome hard and strong.

Fish cannot leave deep waters,
And a country's weapons should not be displayed.


</p>
<p id="t4d37">Tao abides in non-action,
Yet nothing is left undone.
If kings and lords observed this,
The ten thousand things would develop naturally.
If they still desired to act,
They would return to the simplicity of formless substance.
Without for there is no desire.
Without desire there is.
And in this way all things would be at peace.


</p>
<p id="t4d38">A truly good man is not aware of his goodness,
And is therefore good.
A foolish man tries to be good,
And is therefore not good.

A truly good man does nothing,
Yet leaves nothing undone.
A foolish man is always doing,
Yet much remains to be done.

When a truly kind man does something, he leaves nothing undone.
When a just man does something, he leaves a great deal to be done.
When a disciplinarian does something and no one responds,
He rolls up his sleeves in an attempt to enforce order.

Therefore when Tao is lost, there is goodness.
When goodness is lost, there is kindness.
When kindness is lost, there is justice.
When justice is lost, there ritual.
Now ritual is the husk of faith and loyalty, the beginning of confusion.
Knowledge of the future is only a flowery trapping of Tao.
It is the beginning of folly.

Therefore the truly great man dwells on what is real and not what is on the surface,
On the fruit and not the flower.
Therefore accept the one and reject the other.


</p>
<p id="t4d39">These things from ancient times arise from one:
The sky is whole and clear.
The earth is whole and firm.
The spirit is whole and strong.
The valley is whole and full.
The ten thousand things are whole and alive.
Kings and lords are whole, and the country is upright.
All these are in virtue of wholeness.

The clarity of the sky prevents its falling.
The firmness of the earth prevents its splitting.
The strength of the spirit prevents its being used up.
The fullness of the valley prevents its running dry.
The growth of the ten thousand things prevents their drying out.
The leadership of kings and lords prevents the downfall of the country.

Therefore the humble is the root of the noble.
The low is the foundation of the high.
Princes and lords consider themselves "orphaned", "widowed" and "worthless".
Do they not depend on being humble?

Too much success is not an advantage.
Do not tinkle like jade
Or clatter like stone chimes.


</p>
<p id="t4d40">Returning is the motion of the Tao.
Yielding is the way of the Tao.
The ten thousand things are born of being.
Being is born of not being.


</p>
<p id="t4d41">The wise student hears of the Tao and practices it diligently.
The average student hears of the Tao and gives it thought now and again.
The foolish student hears of the Tao and laughs aloud.
If there were no laughter, the Tao would not be what it is.

Hence it is said:
The bright path seems dim;
Going forward seems like retreat;
The easy way seems hard;
The highest Virtue seems empty;
Great purity seems sullied;
A wealth of Virtue seems inadequate;
The strength of Virtue seems frail;
Real Virtue seems unreal;
The perfect square has no corners;
Great talents ripen late;
The highest notes are hard to hear;
The greatest form has no shape;
The Tao is hidden and without name.
The Tao alone nourishes and brings everything to fulfillment.


</p>
<p id="t4d42">The Tao begot one.
One begot two.
Two begot three.
And three begot the ten thousand things.

The ten thousand things carry yin and embrace yang.
They achieve harmony by combining these forces.

Men hate to be "orphaned," "widowed," or "worthless,"
But this is how kings and lords describe themselves.

For one gains by losing
And loses by gaining.

What others teach, I also teach; that is:
"A violent man will die a violent death!"
This will be the essence of my teaching.


</p>
<p id="t4d43">The softest thing in the universe
Overcomes the hardest thing in the universe.
That without substance can enter where there is no room.
Hence I know the value of non-action.

Teaching without words and work without doing
Are understood by very few.


</p>
<p id="t4d44">Fame or self:  Which matters more?
Self or wealth:  Which is more precious?
Gain or loss:  Which is more painful?

He who is attached to things will suffer much.
He who saves will suffer heavy loss.
A contented man is never disappointed.
He who knows when to stop does not find himself in trouble.
He will stay forever safe.


</p>
<p id="t4d45">Great accomplishment seems imperfect,
Yet it does not outlive its usefulness.
Great fullness seems empty,
Yet cannot be exhausted.

Great straightness seems twisted.
Great intelligence seems stupid.
Great eloquence seems awkward.

Movement overcomes cold.
Stillness overcomes heat.
Stillness and tranquility set things in order in the universe.


</p>
<p id="t4d46">When the Tao is present in the universe,
The horses haul manure.
When the Tao is absent from the universe,
War horses are bred outside the city.

There is no greater sin than desire,
No greater curse than discontent,
No greater misfortune than wanting something for oneself.
Therefore he who knows that enough is enough will always have enough.


</p>
<p id="t4d47">Without going outside, you may know the whole world.
Without looking through the window, you may see the ways of heaven.
The farther you go, the less you know.

Thus the sage knows without traveling;
He sees without looking;
He works without doing.


</p>
<p id="t4d48">In the pursuit of learning, every day something is acquired.
In the pursuit of Tao, every day something is dropped.

Less and less is done
Until non-action is achieved.
When nothing is done, nothing is left undone.

The world is ruled by letting things take their course.
It cannot be ruled by interfering.


</p>
<p id="t4d49">The sage has no mind of his own.
He is aware of the needs of others.

I am good to people who are good.
I am also good to people who are not good.
Because Virtue is goodness.
I have faith in people who are faithful.
I also have faith in people who are not faithful.
Because Virtue is faithfulness.

The sage is shy and humble - to the world he seems confusing.
Others look to him and listen.
He behaves like a little child.


</p>
<p id="t4d50">Between birth and death,
Three in ten are followers of life,
Three in ten are followers of death,
And men just passing from birth to death also number three in ten.
Why is this so?
Because they live their lives on the gross level.

He who knows how to live can walk abroad
Without fear of rhinoceros or tiger.
He will not be wounded in battle.
For in him rhinoceroses can find no place to thrust their horn,
Tigers no place to use their claws,
And weapons no place to pierce.
Why is this so?
Because he has no place for death to enter.


</p>
<p id="t4d51">All things arise from Tao.
They are nourished by Virtue.
They are formed from matter.
They are shaped by environment.
Thus the ten thousand things all respect Tao and honor Virtue.
Respect of Tao and honor of Virtue are not demanded,
But they are in the nature of things.

Therefore all things arise from Tao.
By Virtue they are nourished,
Developed, cared for,
Sheltered, comforted,
Grown, and protected.
Creating without claiming,
Doing without taking credit,
Guiding without interfering,
This is Primal Virtue.


</p>
<p id="t4d52">The beginning of the universe
Is the mother of all things.
Knowing the mother, on also knows the sons.
Knowing the sons, yet remaining in touch with the mother,
Brings freedom from the fear of death.

Keep your mouth shut,
Guard the senses,
And life is ever full.
Open your mouth,
Always be busy,
And life is beyond hope.

Seeing the small is insight;
Yielding to force is strength.
Using the outer light, return to insight,
And in this way be saved from harm.
This is learning constancy.


</p>
<p id="t4d53">If I have even just a little sense,
I will walk on the main road and my only fear
    will be of straying from it.
Keeping to the main road is easy,
But people love to be sidetracked.

When the court is arrayed in splendor,
The fields are full of weeds,
And the granaries are bare.
Some wear gorgeous clothes,
Carry sharp swords,
And indulge themselves with food and drink;
They have more possessions than they can use.
They are robber barons.
This is certainly not the way of Tao.


</p>
<p id="t4d54">What is firmly established cannot be uprooted.
What is firmly grasped cannot slip away.
It will be honored from generation to generation.

Cultivate Virtue in your self,
And Virtue will be real.
Cultivate it in the family,
And Virtue will abound.
Cultivate it in the village,
And Virtue will grow.
Cultivate it in the nation,
And Virtue will be abundant.
Cultivate it in the universe,
And Virtue will be everywhere.

Therefore look at the body as body;
Look at the family as family;
Look at the village as village;
Look at the nation as nation;
Look at the universe as universe.

How do I know the universe is like this?
By looking!


</p>
<p id="t4d55">He who is filled with Virtue is like a newborn child.
Wasps and serpents will not sting him;
Wild beasts will not pounce upon him;
He will not be attacked by birds of prey.
His bones are soft, his muscles weak,
But his grip is firm.
He has not experienced the union of man and woman, but is whole.
His manhood is strong.
He screams all day without becoming hoarse.
This is perfect harmony.

Knowing harmony is constancy.
Knowing constancy is enlightenment.

It is not wise to rush about.
Controlling the breath causes strain.
If too much energy is used, exhaustion follows.
This is not the way of Tao.
Whatever is contrary to Tao will not last long.


</p>
<p id="t4d56">Those who know do not talk.
Those who talk do not know.

Keep your mouth closed.
Guard your senses.
Temper your sharpness.
Simplify your problems.
Mask your brightness.
Be at one with the dust of the Earth.
This is primal union.

He who has achieved this state
Is unconcerned with friends and enemies,
With good and harm, with honor and disgrace.
This therefore is the highest state of man.


</p>
<p id="t4d57">Rule a nation with justice.
Wage war with surprise moves.
Become master of the universe without striving.
How do I know that this is so?
Because of this!

The more laws and restrictions there are,
The poorer people become.
The sharper men's weapons,
The more trouble in the land.
The more ingenious and clever men are,
The more strange things happen.
The more rules and regulations,
The more thieves and robbers.

Therefore the sage says:
    I take no action and people are reformed.
    I enjoy peace and people become honest.
    I do nothing and people become rich.
    I have no desires and people return to the good and  simple life.


</p>
<p id="t4d58">When the country is ruled with a light hand
The people are simple.
When the country is ruled with severity,
The people are cunning.

Happiness is rooted in misery.
Misery lurks beneath happiness.
Who knows what the future holds?
There is no honesty.
Honesty becomes dishonest.
Goodness becomes witchcraft.
Man's bewitchment lasts for a long time.

Therefore the sage is sharp but not cutting,
Pointed but not piercing,
Straightforward but not unrestrained,
Brilliant but not blinding.


</p>
<p id="t4d59">In caring for others and serving heaven,
There is nothing like using restraint.
Restraint begins with giving up one's own ideas.
This depends on Virtue gathered in the past.
If there is a good store of Virtue, then nothing is impossible.
If nothing is impossible, then there are no limits.
If a man knows no limits, then he is fit to be a ruler.
The mother principle of ruling holds good for a long time.
This is called having deep roots and a firm foundation,
The Tao of long life and eternal vision.


</p>
<p id="t4d60">Ruling the country is like cooking a small fish.
Approach the universe with Tao,
And evil is not powerful,
But its power will not be used to harm others.
Not only will it do no harm to others,
But the sage himself will also be protected.
They do not hurt each other,
And the Virtue in each one refreshes both.


</p>
<p id="t4d61">A great country is like low land.
It is the meeting ground of the universe,
The mother of the universe.

The female overcomes the male with stillness,
Lying low in stillness.

Therefore if a great country gives way to a smaller country,
It will conquer the smaller country.
And if a small country submits to a great country,
It can conquer the great country.
Therefore those who would conquer must yield,
And those who conquer do so because they yield.

A great nation needs more people;
A small country needs to serve.
Each gets what it wants.
It is fitting for a great nation to yield.


</p>
<p id="t4d62">Tao is source of the ten thousand things.
It is the treasure of the good man, and the refuge of the bad.
Sweet words can buy honor;
Good deeds can gain respect.
If a man is bad, do not abandon him.
Therefore on the day the emperor is crowned,
Or the three officers of state installed,
Do not send a gift of jade and a team of four horses,
But remain still and offer the Tao.
Why does everyone like the Tao so much at first?
Isn't it because you find what you seek and are forgiven when you sin?
Therefore this is the greatest treasure of the universe.


</p>
<p id="t4d63">Practice non-action.
Work without doing.
Taste the tasteless.
Magnify the small, increase the few.
Reward bitterness with care.

See simplicity in the complicated.
Achieve greatness in little things.

In the universe the difficult things are done as if they are easy.
In the universe great acts are made up of small deeds.
The sage does not attempt anything very big,
And thus achieved greatness.

Easy promises make for little trust.
Taking things lightly results in great difficulty.
Because the sage always confronts difficulties,
He never experiences them.


</p>
<p id="t4d64">Peace is easily maintained;
Trouble is easily overcome before it starts.
The brittle is easily shattered;
The small is easily scattered.

Deal with it before it happens.
Set things in order before there is confusion.

A tree as great as a man's embrace springs up from a small shoot;
A terrace nine stories high begins with a pile of earth;
A journey of a thousand miles starts under ones feet.

He who acts defeats his own purpose;
He who grasps loses.
The sage does not act, and so is not defeated.
He does not grasp and therefore does not lose.

People usually fail when they are on the verge of success.
So give as much care to the end as to the beginning;
Then there will be no failure.

Therefore the sage seeks freedom from desire.
He does not collect precious things.
He learns not to hold on to ideas.
He brings men back to what they have lost.
He help the ten thousand things find their own nature,
But refrains from action.


</p>
<p id="t4d65">In the beginning those who knew the Tao did not try to enlighten others,
But kept it hidden.
Why is it so hard to rule?
Because people are so clever.
Rulers who try to use cleverness
Cheat the country.
Those who rule without cleverness
Are a blessing to the land.
These are the two alternatives.
Understanding these is Primal Virtue.
Primal Virtue is deep and far.
It leads all things back
Toward the great oneness.


</p>
<p id="t4d66">Why is the sea king of a hundred streams?
Because it lies below them.
Therefore it is the king of a hundred streams.

If the sage would guide the people, he must serve with humility.
If he would lead them, he must follow behind.
In this way when the sage rules, the people will not feel oppressed;
When he stands before them, they will not be harmed.
The whole world will support him and will not tire of him.

Because he does not compete,
He does not meet competition.


</p>
<p id="t4d67">Everyone under heaven says that my Tao is great and beyond compare.
Because it is great, it seems different.
If it were not different, it would have vanished long ago.

I have three treasures which I hold and keep.
The first is mercy; the second is economy;
The third is daring not to be ahead of others.
From mercy comes courage; from economy comes generosity;
From humility comes leadership.

Nowadays men shun mercy, but try to be brave;
They abandon economy, but try to be generous;
They do not believe in humility, but always try to be first.
This is certain death.

Mercy brings victory in battle and strength in defense.
It is the means by which heaven saves and guards.


</p>
<p id="t4d68">A good soldier is not violent.
A good fighter is not angry.
A good winner is not vengeful
A good employer is humble.
This is known as the Virtue of not striving.
This is known as ability to deal with people.
This since ancient times has been known as the ultimate unity with heaven.


</p>
<p id="t4d69">There is a saying among soldiers:
    I dare not make the first move but would rather play the guest;
    I dare not advance and inch but would rather withdraw a foot.

This is called marching without appearing to move,
Rolling up your sleeves without showing your arm,
Capturing the enemy without attacking,
Being armed without weapons.

There is no greater catastrophe than underestimating the enemy.
By underestimating the enemy, I almost lost what I value.

Therefore when the battle is joined,
The underdog will win.


</p>
<p id="t4d70">My words are easy to understand and easy to perform,
Yet no man under heaven knows them or practices them.

My words have ancient beginnings.
My actions are disciplined.
Because men do not understand, they have no knowledge of me.

Those that know me are few;
Those that abuse me are honored.
Therefore the sage wears rough clothing and holds the jewel in his heart.


</p>
<p id="t4d71">Knowing ignorance is strength.
Ignoring knowledge is sickness.

If one is sick of sickness, then one is not sick.
The sage is not sick because he is sick of sickness.
Therefore he is not sick.


</p>
<p id="t4d72">When men lack a sense of awe, there will be disaster.

Do not intrude in their homes.
Do not harass them at work.
If you do not interfere, they will not weary of you.

Therefore the sage knows himself but makes no show,
Has self-respect but is not arrogant.
He lets go of that and chooses this.


</p>
<p id="t4d73">A brave and passionate man will kill or be killed.
A brave and calm man will always preserve life.
Of these two which is good and which is harmful?
Some things are not favored by heaven.  Who knows why?
Even the sage is unsure of this.

The Tao of heaven does not strive, and yet it overcomes.
It does not speak, and yet is answered.
It does not ask, yet is supplied with all its needs.
It seems to have no aim and yet its purpose is fulfilled.

Heaven's net casts wide.
Though its meshes are course, nothing slips through.


</p>
<p id="t4d74">If men are not afraid to die,
It is no avail to threaten them with death.

If men live in constant fear of dying,
And if breaking the law means that a man will be killed,
Who will dare to break the law?

There is always an official executioner.
If you try to take his place,
It is like trying to be a master carpenter and cutting wood.
If you try to cut wood like a master carpenter, you will only hurt your hand.


</p>
<p id="t4d75">Why are the people starving?
Because the rulers eat up the money in taxes.
Therefore the people are starving.

Why are the people rebellious?
Because the rulers interfere too much.
Therefore they are rebellious.

Why do the people think so little of death?
Because the rulers demand too much of life.
Therefore the people take death lightly.

Having little to live on, one knows better than to value life too much.


</p>
<p id="t4d76">A man is born gentle and weak.
At his death he is hard and stiff.
Green plants are tender and filled with sap.
At their death they are withered and dry.

Therefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death.
The gentle and yielding is the disciple of life.

Thus an army without flexibility never wins a battle.
A tree that is unbending is easily broken.

The hard and strong will fall.
The soft and weak will overcome.


</p>
<p id="t4d77">The Tao of heaven is like the bending of a bow.
The high is lowered, and the low is raised.
If the string is too long, it is shortened;
If there is not enough, it is made longer.

The Tao of heaven is to take from those who have too much and give to those who do not have enough.
Man's way is different.
He takes from those who do not have enough and give to those who already have too much.
What man has more than enough and gives it to the world?
Only the man of Tao.

Therefore the sage works without recognition.
He achieves what has to be done without dwelling on it.
He does not try to show his knowledge.


</p>
<p id="t4d78">Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water.
Yet for attacking the solid and strong, nothing is better;
It has no equal.
The weak can overcome the strong;
The supple can overcome the stiff.
Under heaven everyone knows this,
Yet no one puts it into practice.
Therefore the sage says:
He who takes upon himself the humiliation of the people is fit to rule them.
He who takes upon himself the country's disasters deserves to be king of the universe.
The truth often sounds paradoxical.


</p>
<p id="t4d79">After a bitter quarrel, some resentment must remain.
What can one do about it?
Therefore the sage keeps his half of the bargain
But does not exact his due.
A man of Virtue performs his part,
But a man without Virtue requires others to fulfill their obligations.
The Tao of heaven is impartial.
It stays with good men all the time.


</p>
<p id="t4d80">A small country has fewer people.
Though there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster than man, they are not needed.
The people take death seriously and do not travel far.
Though they have boats and carriages, no one uses them.
Though they have armor and weapons, no one displays them.
Men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing.
Their food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple, their homes secure;
They are happy in their ways.
Though they live within sight of their neighbors,
And crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way,
Yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die.


</p>
<p id="t4d81">Truthful words are not beautiful.
Beautiful words are not truthful.
Good men do not argue.
Those who argue are not good.
Those who know are not learned.
The learned do not know.

The sage never tries to store things up.
The more he does for others, the more he has.
The more he gives to others, the greater his abundance.
The Tao of heaven is pointed but does no harm.
The Tao of the sage is work without effort.
</p>
<p id="t5d01">The way you can go
isn't the real way.
The name you can say
isn't the real name.

Heaven and earth
begin in the unnamed:
name's the mother
of the ten thousand things.

So the unwanting soul
sees what's hidden,
and the ever-wanting soul
sees only what it wants.

Two things, one origin,
but different in name,
whose identity is mystery.
Mystery of all mysteries!
The door to the hidden.</p>
<p id="t5d02">Everybody on earth knowing
that beauty is beautiful
makes ugliness.

Everybody knowing
that goodness is good
makes wickedness.

For being and nonbeing
arise together;
hard and easy
complete each other;
long and short
shape each other;
high and low
depend on each other;
note and voice
make the music together;
before and after
follow each other.

That's why the wise soul
does without doing,
teaches without talking.

The things of this world
exist, they are;
you can't refuse them.

To bear and not to own;
to act and not lay claim;
to do the work and let it go:
for just letting it go
is what makes it stay.</p>
<p id="t5d03">Not praising the praiseworthy
keeps people uncompetitive.

Not prizing rare treasures
keeps people from stealing.

Not looking at the desirable
keeps the mind quiet.

So the wise soul
governing people
would empty their minds,
fill their bellies,
weaken their wishes,
strengthen their bones,

keep people unknowing,
unwanting,
keep the ones who do know
from doing anything.

When you do not-doing,
nothing's out of order.</p>
<p id="t5d04">The way is empty,
used, but not used up.
Deep, yes! Ancestral
to the ten thousand things.

Blunting edge,
loosing bond,
dimming light,
the way is the dust of the way.

Quiet,
yes, and likely to endure.
Whose child? Born
before the gods.</p>
<p id="t5d05">Heaven and earth aren't humane.
To them the ten thousand things
are straw dogs.

Wise souls aren't humane.
To them the hundred families
are straw dogs.

Heaven and earth act as a bellows:

Empty yet structured,
it moves, inexhaustibly giving.</p>
<p id="t5d06">The valley spirit never dies.
Call it the mystery, the woman.

The mystery,
the Door of the Woman,
is the root
of earth and heaven.

Forever this endures, forever.
And all its uses are easy.</p>
<p id="t5d07">Heaven will last,
earth will endure.
How can they last so long?
They don't exist for themselves
and so can go on and on.

So wise souls
leaving self behind
move forward,
and setting self aside
stay centered.
Why let the self go?
To keep what the soul needs.</p>
<p id="t5d08">True goodness
is like water.
Water's good
for everything.
It doesn't compete.

It goes right
to the low loathsome places,
and so finds the way.

For a house,
the good thing is level ground.
In thinking,
depth is good.
The good of giving is magnanimity;
of speaking, honesty;
of government, order.
The good of work is skill,
and of action, timing.

No competition, so no blame.</p>
<p id="t5d09">Brim-fill the bowl,
it'll spill over.
Keep sharpening the blade,
you'll soon blunt it.

Nobody can protect
a house full of gold and jade.

Wealth, status, pride,
are their own ruin.
To do good, work well, and lie low
is the way of the blessing.</p>
<p id="t5d10">Can you keep your soul in its body,
hold fast to the one,
and so learn to be whole?
Can you center your energy,
be soft, tender,
and so learn to be a baby?

Can you keep the deep water still and clear,
so it reflects without blurring?
Can you love people and run things,
And do so by not doing?

Opening, closing the Gate of Heaven,
can you be like a bird with her nestlings?
Piercing bright through the cosmos,
can you know by not knowing?

To give birth, to nourish,
to bear and not to own,
to act and not lay claim,
to lead and not to rule:
this is mysterious power.</p>
<p id="t5d11">Thirty spokes,
meet in the hub.
Where the wheel isn't
is where it's useful

Hollowed out,
clay makes a pot.
Where the pot's not
is where it's useful.

Cut doors and windows
to make a room.
Where the room isn't,
there's room for you.

So the profit in what is
is in the use of what isn't.</p>
<p id="t5d12">The five colors
blind our eyes.
The five notes
deafen our ears.
The five flavors
dull our taste.

Racing, chasing, hunting,
drives people crazy.
Trying to get rich
ties people in knots.

So the wise soul
watches with the inner
not the outward eye,
letting that go,
keeping this.</p>
<p id="t5d13">To be in favor or disgrace
is to live in fear.
To take the body seriously
is to admit one can suffer.

What does that mean,
to be in favor or disgrace
is to live in fear?
Favor debases:
we fear to lose it,
fear to win it.
So to be in favor or disgrace
is to live in fear.

What does that mean,
to take the body seriously
is to admit one can suffer?
I suffer because I'm a body;
if I weren't a body,
how could I suffer?

So people who set their bodily good
before the public good
could be entrusted with the commonwealth,
and people who treated the body politic
as gently as their own body
would be worthy to govern the commonwealth.</p>
<p id="t5d14">Look at it: nothing to see.
Call it colorless.
Listen to it: nothing to hear.
Call it soundless.
Reach for it: nothing to hold.
Call it intangible.

Triply undifferentiated,
it merges into oneness,
not bright above,
not dark below.

Never, oh! never
can it be named.
It reverts, it returns
to unbeing.
Call it the form of the unformed,
the image of no image.

Call it unthinkable thought.
Face it: no face.
Follow it: no end.

Holding fast to the old Way,
we can live in the present.
Mindful of the ancient beginnings,
we hold the thread of the Tao.</p>
<p id="t5d15">Once upon a time
people who knew the Way
were subtle, spiritual, mysterious, penetrating, unfathomable.

Since they're inexplicable
I can only say what they seemed like:
Cautious, oh yes, as if wading through a winter river.
Alert, as if afraid of the neighbors.
Polite and quiet, like houseguests.
Elusive, like melting ice.
Blank, like uncut wood.
Empty, like valleys.
Mysterious, oh yes, they were like troubled water.

Who can by stillness, little by little
make what is troubled grow clear?
Who can by movement, little by little
make what is still grow quick?

To follow the Way
is not to need fulfillment.
Unfulfilled, one may live on
needing no renewal.</p>
<p id="t5d16">Be completely empty.
Be perfectly serene.
The ten thousand things arise together;
in their arising is their return.
Now they flower,
and flowering
sink homeward,
returning to the root.

The return to the root
is peace.
Peace: to accept what must be,
to know what endures.
In that knowledge is wisdom.
Without it, ruin, disorder.

To know what endures
is to be openhearted,
magnanimous,
regal,
blessed,
following the Tao,
the way that endures forever.
The body comes to its ending,
but there is nothing to fear.</p>
<p id="t5d17">True leaders
are hardly known to their followers.
Next after them are the leaders
the people know and admire;
after them, those they fear;
after them, those they despise.

To give no trust
is to get no trust.

When the work's done right,
with no fuss or boasting,
ordinary people say,
Oh, we did it.</p>
<p id="t5d18">In the degradation of the great way
come benevolence and righteousness.
With the exaltation of learning and prudence
comes immense hypocrisy.
The disordered family
is full of dutiful children and parents.
The disordered society
is full of loyal patriots.</p>
<p id="t5d19">Stop being holy, forget being prudent,
it'll be a hundred times better for everyone.
Stop being altruistic, forget being righteous,
people will remember what family feeling is.
Stop planning, forget making a profit,
there won't be any thieves and robbers.

But even these three rules
needn't be followed; what works reliably
is to know the raw silk,
hold the uncut wood.
Need little,
want less.
Forget the rules.
Be untroubled.</p>
<p id="t5d20">How much difference between yes and no?
What difference between good and bad?

What the people fear
must be feared.
O desolation!
Not yet, not yet has it reached its limit!

Everybody's cheerful,
cheerful as if at a party,
or climbing a tower in springtime.
And here I sit unmoved,
clueless, like a child,
a baby too young to smile.

Forlorn, forlorn.
Like a homeless person.
Most people have plenty.
I'm the one that's poor,
a fool right through.

Ignorant, ignorant.
Most people are so bright.
I'm the one that's dull.
Most people are so keen.
I don't have the answers.
Oh, I'm desolate, at sea,
adrift, without harbor.

Everybody has something to do.
I'm the clumsy one, out of place.
I'm the different one,
for my food
is the milk of the mother.</p>
<p id="t5d21">The greatest power is the gift
of following the Way alone.
How the Way does things
is hard to grasp, elusive.
Elusive, yes, hard to grasp,
yet there are thoughts in it.
Hard to grasp, yes, elusive,
yet there are things in it.
Hard to make out, yes, and obscure,
yet there is spirit in it,
veritable spirit.
There is certainty in it.
From long, long ago till now
it has kept its name.
So it saw
the beginning of everything.

How do I know
anything about the beginning?
By this.</p>
<p id="t5d22">Be broken to be whole.
Twist to be straight.
Be empty to be full.
Wear out to be renewed.
Have little and gain much.
Have much and get confused.

So wise souls hold to the one,
and test all things against it.

Not showing themselves,
they shine forth.
Not justifying themselves,
they're self-evident.
Not praising themselves,
they're accomplished.
Not competing,
they have in all the world no competitor.

What they used to say in the old days,
“Be broken to be whole,”
was that mistaken?
Truly, to be whole
is to return.</p>
<p id="t5d23">Nature doesn't make long speeches.
A whirlwind doesn't last all morning.
A cloudburst doesn't last all day.
Who makes the wind and rain?
Heaven and earth do.
If heaven and earth don't go on and on,
certainly people don't need to.

The people who work with Tao
are Tao people,
they belong to the Way.
People who work with power
belong to power.
People who work with loss
belong to what's lost.

Give yourself to the Way
and you'll be at home on the Way.
Give yourself to power
and you'll be at home in power.
Give yourself to loss
and when you're lost you'll be at home.

To give no trust
is to get no trust.</p>
<p id="t5d24">You can't keep standing on tiptoe
or walk in leaps and bounds.
You can't shine by showing off
or get ahead by pushing.
Self-satisfied people do no good,
self-promoters never grow up.

Such stuff is to the Tao
as garbage is to food
or a tumor to the body,
hateful.
The follower of the Way
avoids it.</p>
<p id="t5d25">There is something
that contains everything.
Before heaven and earth
it is.
Oh, it is still, unbodied,
all on its own, unchanging,

all-pervading,
ever-moving.
So it can act as the mother
of all things.
Not knowing its real name,
we only call it the Way.

If it must be named,
let its name be Great.
Greatness means going on,
going on means going far,
and going far means turning back.

So they say: “The Way is great,
heaven is great,
earth is great,
and humankind is great;
four greatnesses in the world,
and humanity is one of them.”

People follow earth,
earth follows heaven,
heaven follows the Way,
the Way follows what is.</p>
<p id="t5d26">Heavy is the root of light.
Still is the master of moving.

So wise souls make their daily march
with the heavy baggage wagon.

Only when safe
in a solid, quiet house
do they lay care aside.

How can a lord of ten thousand chariots
let his own person
weigh less in the balance than his land?
Lightness will lose him his foundation,
movement will lose him his mastery.</p>
<p id="t5d27">Good walkers leave no track.
Good talkers don't stammer.
Good counters don't use their fingers.
The best door's unlocked and unopened.
The best knot's not in a rope and can't be untied.

So wise souls are good at caring for people,
never turning their back on anyone.
They're good at looking after things,
never turning their back on anything.
There's a light hidden here.

Good people teach people who aren't good yet;
the less good are the makings of the good.
Anyone who doesn't respect a teacher
or cherish a student
may be clever, but has gone astray.
There's a deep mystery here.</p>
<p id="t5d28">Knowing man
and staying woman,
be the riverbed of the world.
Being the world's riverbed
of eternal unfailing power
is to go back again to be newborn.

Knowing light
and staying dark,
be a pattern to the world.
Being the world's pattern
of eternal unerring power
is to go back again to boundlessness.

Knowing glory
and staying modest,
be the valley of the world.
Being the world's valley
of eternal inexhaustible power
is to go back again to the natural.

Natural wood is cut up
and made into useful things.
Wise souls are used
to make into leaders.
Just so, a great carving
is done without cutting.</p>
<p id="t5d29">Those who think to win the world
by doing something to it,
I see them come to grief.
For the world is a sacred object.
Nothing is to be done to it.
To do anything to it is to damage it.
To seize it is to lose it.

Under heaven some things lead, some follow,
some blow hot, some cold,
some are strong, some weak,
some are fulfilled, some fail.

So the wise soul keeps away
from the extremes, excess, extravagance.</p>
<p id="t5d30">A Taoist wouldn't advise a ruler
to use force of arms for conquest;
that tactic backfires.

Where the army marched
grow thorns and thistles.
After the war
come the bad harvests.
Good leaders prosper, that's all,
not presuming on victory.
They prosper without boasting,
or domineering, or arrogance,
prosper because they can't help it,
prosper without violence.

Things flourish then perish.
Not the Way.
What's not the Way
soon ends.</p>
<p id="t5d31">Even the best weapon
is an unhappy tool,
hateful to living things.
So the follower of the Way
stays away from it.

Weapons are unhappy tools,
not chosen by thoughtful people,
to be used only when there is no choice,
and with a calm, still mind,
without enjoyment.
To enjoy using weapons
is to enjoy killing people,
and to enjoy killing people
is to lose your share in the common good.

It is right that the murder of many people
be mourned and lamented.
It is right that a victor in war
be received with funeral ceremonies.</p>
<p id="t5d32">The way goes on forever nameless.
Uncut wood, nothing important,
yet nobody under heaven
dare try to carve it.
If rulers and leaders could use it,
the ten thousand things
would gather in homage,
heaven and earth would drop sweet dew,
and people, without being ordered,
would be fair to one another.

To order, to govern,
is to begin naming;
when names proliferate
it's time to stop.
If you know when to stop
you're in no danger.

The Way in the world
is as a stream to a valley,
a river to the sea.</p>
<p id="t5d33">Knowing other people is intelligence,
knowing yourself is wisdom.
Overcoming others takes strength,
overcoming yourself takes greatness.
Contentment is wealth.

Boldly pushing forward takes resolution.
Staying put keeps you in position.

To live till you die
is to live long enough.</p>
<p id="t5d34">The Great Way runs
to left, to right,
the ten thousand things
depending on it,
living on it,
accepted by it.

Doing its work,
it goes unnamed.
Clothing and feeding
the ten thousand things,
it lays no claim on them
and asks nothing of them.
Call it a small matter.
The ten thousand things
return to it,
though it lays no claim on them.
Call it great.

So the wise soul
without great doings
achieves greatness.</p>
<p id="t5d35">Hold fast to the great thought
and all the world will come to you,
harmless, peaceable, serene.

Walking around, we stop
for music, for food.
But if you taste the Way
it's flat, insipid.
It looks like nothing much,
it sounds like nothing much.
And yet you can't get enough of it.</p>
<p id="t5d36">What seeks to shrink
must first have grown;
what seeks weakness
surely was strong.
What seeks its ruin
must first have risen;
what seeks to take
has surely given.

This is called the small dark light:
the soft, the weak prevail
over the hard, the strong.</p>
<p id="t5d37">The Way never does anything,
and everything gets done.
If those in power could hold to the Way,
the ten thousand things
would look after themselves.
If even so they tried to act,
I'd quiet them with the nameless,
the natural.

In the unnamed, in the unshapen,
is not wanting.
In not wanting is stillness.
In stillness all under heaven rests.</p>
<p id="t5d38">Great power, not clinging to power,
has true power.
Lesser power, clinging to power,
lacks true power.
Great power, doing nothing,
has nothing to do.
Lesser power, doing nothing,
has an end in view.

The good the truly good do
has no end in view.
The right the very righteous do
has an end in view.
And those who act in true obedience to law
roll up their sleeves
and make the disobedient obey.

So: when we lose the Way we find power;
losing power we find goodness;
losing goodness we find righteousness;
losing righteousness we're left with obedience.

Obedience to law is the dry husk
of loyalty and good faith.
Opinion is the barren flower of the Way,
the beginning of ignorance.

So great-minded people
abide in the kernel not the husk,
in the fruit not the flower,
letting the one go, keeping the other.</p>
<p id="t5d39">Those who of old got to be whole:

Heaven through its wholeness is pure;
earth through its wholeness is steady;
spirit through its wholeness is potent;
the valley through its wholeness flows with rivers;
the ten thousand things through their wholeness live;
rulers through their wholeness have authority.
Their wholeness makes them what they are.

Without what makes it pure, heaven would disintegrate;
without what steadies it, earth would crack apart;
without what makes it potent, spirit would fail;
without what fills it, the valley would run dry;
without what quickens them, the ten thousand things would die;
without what authorizes them, rulers would fall.

The root of the noble is in the common,
the high stands on what's below.
Princes and kings call themselves
“orphans, widowers, beggars,”
to get themselves rooted in the dirt.

A multiplicity of riches
is poverty.
Jade is praised as precious,
but its strength is being stone.</p>
<p id="t5d40">Return is how the Way moves.
Weakness is how the Way works.

Heaven and earth and the ten thousand things
are born of being.
Being is born of nothing.</p>
<p id="t5d41">Thoughtful people hear about the Way
and try hard to follow it.
Ordinary people hear about the Way
and wander onto it and off it.
Thoughtless people hear about the Way
and make jokes about it.
It wouldn't be the Way
if there weren't jokes about it.

So they say:
The Way's brightness looks like darkness;
advancing on the Way feels like retreating;
the plain Way seems hard going.
The height of power seems a valley;
the amplest power seems not enough;
the firmest power seems feeble.
Perfect whiteness looks dirty.
The pure and simple looks chaotic.

The great square has no corners.
The great vessel is never finished.
The great tone is barely heard.
The great thought can't be thought.

The Way is hidden
in its namelessness.
But only the Way
begins, sustains, fulfills.</p>
<p id="t5d42">The Way bears one.
The one bears two.
The two bear three.
The three bear the ten thousand things.
The ten thousand things
carry the yin on their shoulders
and hold in their arms the yang,
whose interplay of energy
makes harmony.

People despise
orphans, widowers, outcasts.
Yet that's what kings and rulers call themselves.
Whatever you lose, you've won.
Whatever you win, you've lost.

What others teach, I say too:
violence and aggression
destroy themselves.
My teaching rests on that.</p>
<p id="t5d43">What's softest in the world
rushes and runs|
over what's hardest in the world.

The immaterial
enters
the impenetrable.

So I know the good in not doing.

The wordless teaching,
the profit in not doing—
not many people understand it.</p>
<p id="t5d44">Which is nearer,
name or self?
Which is dearer,
self or wealth?
Which gives more pain,
loss or gain?

All you grasp will be thrown away.
All you hoard will be utterly lost.

Contentment keeps disgrace away.
Restraint keeps you out of danger
so you can go on for a long, long time.</p>
<p id="t5d45">What's perfectly whole seems flawed,
but you can use it forever.
What's perfectly full seems empty,
but you can't use it up.

True straightness looks crooked.
Great skill looks clumsy.
Real eloquence seems to stammer.

To be comfortable in the cold, keep moving;
to be comfortable in the heat, hold still;
to be comfortable in the world, stay calm and clear.</p>
<p id="t5d46">When the world's on the Way,
they use horses to haul manure.
When the world gets off the Way,
they breed warhorses on the common.

The greatest evil: wanting more.
The worst luck: discontent.
Greed's the curse of life.

To know enough's enough
is enough to know.</p>
<p id="t5d47">You don't have to go out the door
to know what goes on in the world.
You don't have to look out the window
to see the way of heaven.
The farther you go,
the less you know.

So the wise soul
doesn't go, but knows;
doesn't look, but sees;
doesn't do, but gets it done.</p>
<p id="t5d48">Studying and learning daily you grow larger.
Following the Way daily you shrink.
You get smaller and smaller.
So you arrive at not doing.
You do nothing and nothing's not done.

To run things,
don't fuss with them.
Nobody who fusses
is fit to run things.</p>
<p id="t5d49">The wise have no mind of their own,
finding it in the minds
of ordinary people.

They're good to good people
and they're good to bad people.
Power is goodness.
They trust people of good faith
and they trust people of bad faith.
Power is trust.

They mingle their life with the world,
they mix their mind up with the world.
Ordinary people look after them.
Wise souls are children.</p>
<p id="t5d50">To look for life
is to find death.
The thirteen organs of our living
are the thirteen organs of our dying.
Why are the organs of our life
where death enters us?
Because we hold too hard to living.

So I've heard
if you live in the right way,
when you cross country
you needn't fear to meet a mad bull or a tiger;
when you're in a battle
you needn't fear the weapons.
The bull would find nowhere to jab its horns,
the tier nowhere to stick its claws,
the sword nowhere for its point to go.
Why? Because there's nowhere in you
for death to enter.</p>
<p id="t5d51">The Way bears them;
power nurtures them;
their own being shapes them;
their own energy completes them.
And not one of the ten thousand things
fails to hold the Way sacred
or to obey its power.

Their reverence for the Way
and obedience to its power
are unforced and always natural.
For the Way gives them life;
its power nourishes them,
mothers and feeds them,
completes and matures them,
looks after them, protects them.

To have without possessing,
do without claiming,
lead without controlling:
this is mysterious power.</p>
<p id="t5d52">The beginning of everything
is the mother of everything.
Truly to know the mother
is to know her children,
and truly to know the children
is to turn back to the mother.
The body comes to its ending
but there is nothing to fear.

Close the openings,
shut the doors,
and to the end of life
nothing will trouble you.
Open the openings,
be busy with business,
and to the end of life
nothing can help you.

Insight sees the insignificant.
Strength knows how to yield.
Use the way's light, return to its insight,
and so keep from going too far.
That's how to practice what's forever.</p>
<p id="t5d53">If my mind's modest,
I walk the great way.
Arrogance
is all I fear.

The great way is low and plain,
but people like shortcuts over the mountains.

The palace is full of splendor
and the fields are full of weeds
and the granaries are full of nothing.

People wearing ornaments and fancy clothes,
carrying weapons,
drinking a lot and eating a lot,
having a lot of things, a lot of money:
shameless thieves.
Surely their way
isn't the way.</p>
<p id="t5d54">Well planted is not uprooted,
well kept is not lost.
The offerings of the generations
to the ancestors will not cease.

To follow the way yourself is real power.
To follow it in the family is abundant power.
To follow it in the community is steady power.
To follow it in the whole country is lasting power.
To follow it in the world is universal power.

So in myself I see what self is,
in my household I see what family is,
in my town I see what community is,
in my nation I see what a country is,
in the world I see what is under heaven.

How do I know the world is so?
By this.</p>
<p id="t5d55">Being full of power
is like being a baby.
Scorpions don't sting,
tigers don't attack,
eagles don't strike.
Soft bones, weak muscles,
but a firm grasp.
Ignorant of the intercourse
of man and woman,
yet the baby penis is erect.
True and perfect energy!
All day long screaming and crying,
but never getting hoarse.
True and perfect harmony!

To know harmony
is to know what's eternal.
To know what's eternal
is enlightenment.
Increase of life is full of portent:
the strong heart exhausts the vital breath.
The full-grown is on the edge of age.
Not the Way.
What's not the Way soon dies.</p>
<p id="t5d56">Who knows
doesn't talk.
Who talks
doesn't know.
Closing the openings,
shutting doors,

blunting edge,
loosing bond,
dimming light,
be one with the dust of the way.
So you come to the deep sameness.

Then you can't be controlled by love
or by rejection.
You can't be controlled by profit
or by loss.
You can't be controlled by praise
or by humiliation.
Then you have honor under heaven.</p>
<p id="t5d57">Run the country by doing what's expected.
Win the war by doing the unexpected.
Control the world by doing nothing.
How do I know that?
By this.

The more restrictions and prohibitions in the world,
the poorer people get.
The more experts the country has
the more of a mess it's in.
The more ingenious the skillful are,
the more monstrous their inventions.
The louder the call for law and order,
the more the thieves and con men multiply.

So a wise leader might say:
I practice inaction, and the people look after themselves.
I love to be quiet, and the people themselves find justice.
I don't do business, and the people prosper on their own.
I don't have wants, and the people themselves are uncut wood.</p>
<p id="t5d58">When the government's dull and confused,
the people are placid.
When the government's sharp and keen,
the people are discontented.
Alas! misery lies under happiness,
and happiness sits on misery, alas!
Who knows where it will end?
Nothing is certain.

The normal changes into the monstrous,
the fortunate into the unfortunate,
and our bewilderment
goes on and on.

And so the wise
shape without cutting,
square without sawing,
true without forcing.
They are the light that does not shine.</p>
<p id="t5d59">In looking after your life and following the way,
gather spirit.
Gather spirit early,
and so redouble power,
and so become invulnerable.

Invulnerable, unlimited,
you can do what you like with material things.
But only if you hold to the Mother of things
will you do it for long.
Have deep roots, a strong trunk.
Live long by looking long.</p>
<p id="t5d60">Rule a big country
the way you cook a small fish.

If you keep control by following the Way,
troubled spirits won't act up.
They won't lose their immaterial strength,
but they won't harm people with it,
nor will wise souls come to harm.
And so, neither harming the other,
these powers will come together in unity.</p>
<p id="t5d61">The polity of greatness
runs downhill like a river to the sea,
joining with everything,
woman to everything.

By stillness the woman
may always dominate the man,
lying quiet underneath him.

So a great country
submitting to small ones, dominates them;
so small countries,
submitting to a great one, dominate it.

Lie low to be on top,
be on top by lying low.</p>
<p id="t5d62">The way is the hearth and home
of the ten thousand things.
Good souls treasure it,
lost souls find shelter in it.

Fine words are for sale,
fine deeds go cheap;
even worthless people can get them.

So, at the coronation of the Son of Heaven
when the Three Ministers take office,
you might race out in a four-horse chariot
to offer a jade screen;
but wouldn't it be better to sit still
and let the Way be your offering?

Why was the Way honored
in the old days?
Wasn't it said:
Seek, you'll find it.
Hide, it will shelter you.
So it was honored under heaven.</p>
<p id="t5d63">Do without doing.
Act without action.
Savor the flavorless.
Treat the small as large,
the few as many.

Meet injury
with the power of goodness.

Study the hard while it's easy.
Do big things while they're small.
The hardest jobs in the world start out easy,
the great affairs of the world start small.

So the wise soul,
by never dealing with great things,
gets great things done.

Now, since taking things too lightly makes them worthless,
and taking things too easy makes them hard,
the wise soul,
by treating the easy as hard,
doesn't find anything hard.</p>
<p id="t5d64">It's easy to keep hold of what hasn't stirred,
easy to plan what hasn't occurred.
It's easy to shatter delicate things,
easy to scatter little things.
Do things before they happen.
Get them straight before they get mixed up.

The tree you can't reach your arms around
grew from a tiny seedling.
The nine-story tower rises
from a heap of clay.
The ten-thousand-mile journey
begins beneath your foot.

Do, and do wrong;
Hold on, and lose.
Not doing, the wise soul
doesn't do it wrong,
and not holding on,
doesn't lose it.
(In all their undertakings,
it's just as they're almost finished
that people go wrong.
Mind the end as the beginning,
then it won't go wrong.)

That's why the wise
want not to want,
care nothing for hard-won treasures,
learn not to be learned,
turn back to what people overlooked.
They go along with things as they are,
but don't presume to act.</p>
<p id="t5d65">Once upon a time
those who ruled according to the Way
didn't use it to make people knowing
but to keep them unknowing.

People get hard to manage
when they know too much.
Whoever rules by intellect
is a curse upon the land.
Whoever rules by ignorance
is a blessing on it.
To understand these things
is to have a pattern and a model,
and to understand the pattern and the model
is mysterious power.

Mysterious power
goes deep.
It reaches far.
It follows things back,
clear back to the great oneness.</p>
<p id="t5d66">Lakes and rivers are lords of the hundred valleys.
Why? Because they'll go lower.
So they're the lords of the hundred valleys.

Just so, a wise soul,
wanting to be above other people,
talks to them from below
and to guide them
follows them.

And so the wise soul
predominates without dominating,
and leads without misleading.
And people don't get tired
of enjoying and praising
one who, not competing,
has in all the world
no competitor.</p>
<p id="t5d67">Everybody says my way is great
but improbable.

All greatness
is improbable.
What's probable
is tedious and petty.

I have three treasures.
I keep and treasure them.
The first, mercy,
the second, moderation,
the third, modesty.
If you're merciful you can be brave,
if you're moderate you can be generous,
and if you don't presume to lead
you can lead the high and mighty.

But to be brave without compassion,
or generous without self-restraint,
or to take the lead,
is fatal.

Compassion wins the battle
and holds the fort;
it is the bulwark set
around those heaven helps.</p>
<p id="t5d68">The best captain doesn't rush in front.
The fiercest fighter doesn't bluster.
The big winner isn't competing.
The best boss takes a low footing.
This is the power of noncompetition.
This is the right use of ability.
To follow heaven's lead
has always been the best way.</p>
<p id="t5d69">The expert in warfare says:
Rather than dare make the attack
I'd take the attack;
rather than dare advance an inch
I'd retreat a foot.

It's called marching without marching,
rolling up your sleeves without flexing your muscles,
being armed without weapons,
giving the attacker no opponent.
Nothing's worse than attacking what yields.
To attack what yields is to throw away the prize.

So, when matched armies meet,
the one who comes to grief
is the true victor.</p>
<p id="t5d70">My words are so easy to understand,
so easy to follow,

and yet nobody in the world
understands or follows them.

Words come from an ancestry,
deeds from a mastery:
when these are unknown, so am I.

In my obscurity
is my value.
That's why the wise
wear their jade under common clothes.</p>
<p id="t5d71">To know without knowing is best.
Not knowing without knowing it is sick.

To be sick of sickness
is the only cure.

The wise aren't sick.
They're sick of sickness,
so they're well.</p>
<p id="t5d72">When we don't fear what we should fear
we are in fearful danger.
We ought not to live in narrow houses,
we ought not to do stupid work.

If we don't accept stupidity
we won't act stupidly.
So, wise souls know but don't show themselves,
look after but don't prize themselves,
letting the one go, keeping the other.</p>
<p id="t5d73">Brave daring leads to death.
Brave caution leads to life.
The choice can be the right one
or the wrong one.

Who will interpret
the judgment of heaven?
Even the wise soul
finds it hard.

The way of heaven
doesn't compete
yet wins handily,
doesn't speak
yet answers fully,
doesn't summon
yet attracts.
It acts
perfectly easily.

The net of heaven
is vast, vast,
wide-meshed,
yet misses nothing.</p>
<p id="t5d74">When normal, decent people don't fear death,
how can you use death to frighten them?
Even when they have a normal fear of death,
who of us dare take and kill the one who doesn't?
When people are normal and decent and death-fearing,
there's always an executioner.
To take the place of that executioner
is to take the place of the great carpenter.
People who cut the great carpenter's wood
seldom get off with their hands unhurt.</p>
<p id="t5d75">People are starving.
The rich gobble taxes,
that's why people are starving.

People rebel.
The rich oppress them,
that's why people rebel.

People hold life cheap.
The rich make it too costly,
that's why people hold it cheap.

But those who don't live for the sake of living
are worth more than the wealth-seekers.</p>
<p id="t5d76">Living people
are soft and tender.
Corpses are hard and stiff.
The ten thousand things,
the living grass, the trees,
are soft, pliant.
Dead, they're dry and brittle.

So hardness and stiffness
go with death;
tenderness, softness,
go with life.

And the hard sword fails,
the stiff tree's felled.
The hard and great go under.
The soft and weak stay up.</p>
<p id="t5d77">The Way of heaven
is like a bow bent to shoot:
its top end brought down,
its lower end raised up.
It brings the high down,
lifts the low,
takes from those who have,
gives to those who have not.

Such is the Way of heaven,
taking from people who have,
giving to people who have not.
Not so the human way:
it takes from those who have not
to fill up those who have.
Who has enough to fill up everybody?
Only those who have the Way.

So the wise
do without claiming,
achieve without asserting,
wishing not to show their worth.</p>
<p id="t5d78">Nothing in the world
is as soft, as weak, as water;
nothing else can wear away
the hard, the strong,
and remain unaltered.
Soft overcomes hard,
weak overcomes strong.
Everybody knows it,
nobody uses the knowledge.

So the wise say:
By bearing common defilements
you become a sacrificer at the altar of earth;
by bearing common evils
you become a lord of the world.

Right words sound wrong.</p>
<p id="t5d79">After a great enmity is settled
some enmity always remains.
How to make peace?
Wise souls keep their part of the contract
and don't make demands on others.
People whose power is real fulfill their obligations;
people whose power is hollow insist on their claims.

The Way of heaven plays no favorites.
It stays with the good.</p>
<p id="t5d80">Let there be a little country without many people.
Let them have tools that do the work of ten or a hundred,
and never use them.
Let them be mindful of death
and disinclined to long journeys.
They'd have ships and carriages,
but no place to go.
They'd have armor and weapons,
but no parades.
Instead of writing,
they might go back to using knotted cords.
They'd enjoy eating,
take pleasure in clothes,
be happy with their houses,
devoted to their customs.

The next little country might be so close
the people could hear cocks crowing
and dogs barking there,
but they'd get old and die
without ever having been there.</p>
<p id="t5d81">True words aren't charming,
charming words aren't true.
Good people aren't contentious,
contentious people aren't good.
People who know aren't learned,
learned people don't know.

Wise souls don't hoard;
the more they do for others the more they have,
the more they give the richer they are.
The Way of heaven profits without destroying.
Doing without outdoing
is the Way of the wise.</p>
